# Checklist: after you join

1. If you don't have a LinkedIn account, get one. Add your mentor and every mentee you know on LinkedIn. And add [us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e10is/) [admins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremieharris/) [too](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-pollari-b555895a/)!

2. We have a deal with [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) to give every mentee $50 in free GPU credits. Use them! To get your credits, message an admin on Slack or post to the mentees channel.

3. You can also get $300 in free GCP credits (any service) via their [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

4. If you write a good blog post, let us know and we'll promote it. We can give you **significant** reach: SharpestMinds content gets **over a quarter of a million** monthly views across all social media platforms, and we have deals with major data science publications like [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com).

# Checklist: once you hit the halfway point of your mentorship

1. Make a list of all the regular, small, technical [meetups](https://www.meetup.com) in your city. Ideally something where you discuss a paper or write actual code in a workshop. Start going, even if you sit in a corner and do nothing the first couple of times. The benefit of having industry people see your face every week compounds quickly.

2. Check out our list of hiring partners [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee/companies). We can often give warm introductions to many of the companies on this list, which lets you to skip their HR screens - a big advantage. **Please keep this list confidential.** You can request warm intros to companies directly through the SharpestMinds web app.

3. Start applying to jobs. Here are some good places to apply for ML jobs [that aren't generally known](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-no-one-will-tell-you-about-data-science-job-applications-bff2d4b5e983):

   👉 Applying through [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com) sends a good signal to hiring managers, because they tend to attract good engineers as applicants. (Applying through Indeed sends a bad signal to hiring managers, so you shouldn't do it.)

   👉 Y Combinator's [Work At A Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com) page is another great one. This lets you submit a single application to all YC companies.

   👉 [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) puts up a "Who Is Hiring?" post every month where companies post open jobs. A great hack is to look up all the past Who Is Hiring posts [at this URL](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring). Instructions on how to apply to each job are included in the comments. Check it out!

   👉 The [Comet ML newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/mljobs?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=forwarded&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ML+Jobs+Newsletter) is another great place to apply for ML jobs. We highly recommend subscribing: you'll get a list of ML jobs delivered to your inbox every two weeks.

7. If the hiring manager whose group / company you're trying to join has a Twitter account, follow it. If they have a blog, read it. Same goes for engineers in the group / company you're trying to join.

# Job search, part 1: creating first impressions

Later on I'll cover how to reach out to companies in your job search. Before that, you need to prepare the way for yourself. In this section I'll cover how to curate your online presence to make your value obvious.

The more obvious your value is, the more receptive companies will be when you reach out to them, and the easier they'll be to negotiate with. If you follow the advice in this section properly, you might even find recruiters start to reach out to you. (Don't let that go to your head - a recruiter reaching out isn't that valuable by itself. It's just a sign you're on the right track.)

## Your personal website and email address

When you apply for jobs, never use Yahoo or Hotmail as your email account. Gmail _can be okay_, but **only** your email address is something like firstname.lastname@gmail.com. It's much better to have an email at your own domain, and to host a personal website at that domain. Your personal website can be very simple, but it does need to exist.

**What to do:** Buy your own domain name and set up a website and email account on it.

If your name is John Q. Smith, your email should be john@jqsmith.com, john@johnqsmith.com or something like that.

Your personal website only needs to have 3.5 things on it:

- Your name.

- A one-line blurb that describes you.

- Links to your other online profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium).

- (Optional but recommended) A nice picture of yourself.

That's it. You can add other things too, if you want. Just make sure those 3 things are on there.

**How to do it:**
1. The fastest and cheapest way to set up your personal website is using [Google Domains.](https://domains.google/) Just follow the instructions in the link, and you can buy a domain name, website hosting, and personalized email domain for a few dollars a month.
2. Once you've done this, add a link to your personal website to your email signature.

**[Here's an example of a great personal website. (Thanks, Phil Glazer! 🙌)](https://pglazer.com)**

**Why you're doing it:** You'll be doing a lot of cold email outreach to companies when you start looking for jobs. When you do, sending an email from your personal domain gives off a strong positive impression.

If the person who receives your email is even slightly interested in talking to you, there's also a good chance they'll also navigate to your personal website if they see a link to it. This puts you in a very strong position, because it means you don't need to sell yourself in your initial email. Your initial email only needs to make them curious; and you can let your website do the rest.

## Your GitHub profile

GitHub is where the rubber hits the road. It's where you show off the real meat of the projects you've done: not just explaining them, but showing the quality of your code. :octocat:

**What to do:** If you don't have a GitHub account, get one. Don't feel bad if it's empty at first. It's _far_ better to have a single project that you're diving deep on than to have 20 projects that are all forks with 1 commit each.

Here's a checklist of the bare minimum your GitHub account should have:
- A repository for each of the projects you've done
- A README file for each of your projects with a clear explanation of what it does and how to run it
- Bonus points: A link to a URL where I can test a demo version of your project
- Bonus points: If this is your mentorship project, include a log in the README of the changes you're making, along with the dates. This makes it obvious your project is under active development

**How to do it:**

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, [create one](http://github.com).

2. Add a profile pic of yourself that matches the profile pics you use on other professional networks (LinkedIn especially).

3. Run through the checklist in the **What to do** section above and make sure you implement everything on there.

4. Add your SharpestMinds mentorship project to your GitHub. This should be one of the projects you're going deep on, so include lots of detail, explanations, and ideally pictures.

**Why you're doing it:** It's basically guaranteed that at some point during your job application process to _any_ company, someone technically capable is going to look at your GitHub profile. So make sure it looks good.

**[Here's an example of a great GitHub profile. (Thanks, Jamel Thomas! 🙌)](https://github.com/thom1178)**

## Your resume

As you gain more experience, your resume will matter less and less. But early on, it matters a lot.

**What to do:** Put together or update your resume. Make sure it's geared towards data science roles.

Here's a list of common mistakes I see in resumes, plus a rating of how bad they are, either 😑 (annoying) or ☠️ (deadly). Avoid them:

- Spelling mistakes ☠️
- Inconsistent formatting 😑
- So much text I can't get through it to read the important parts 😑
- Including a picture of yourself 😑
- Gaps in your timeline so I can't tell what you were doing during some time period ☠️
- Not ordering your timeline chronologically 😑
- Listing Microsoft Office as one of your skills ☠️
- Listing MNIST, the Titanic dataset, or another generic project in your list of projects ☠️
- Submitting your resume in any format other than a PDF ☠️
- Including a detailed description of your graduate thesis if it isn't directly ML-related 😑
- Including a list of publications if they aren't ML-related 😑
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" 😑
- Having a resume that is 1 page long plus one sentence, instead of _either_ 1 page long or 1.5 pages long 😑

And here's a list of things you can do to make your resume stronger, with a rating of how good they are, either 🙌 (solid) or 🎉 (amazing). Do all of these:

- [Include SharpestMinds in your resume under Experience](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) 🎉
- Make sure your Skills section is at the top of the resume 🙌
- Divide your skills into "advanced" skills and "experience with" skills 🙌
- If you've had technical or business jobs before, list your dollar contributions to them (e.g., increase revenues by X%, reduced costs by $Y) 🎉
- List a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series) 🙌
- Provide GitHub links to your best projects 🙌
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading 🎉
- Make sure your writing is clear and concise. Use short sentences, with one idea per sentence 🎉

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a resume, skip the first 2 steps.)

1.  Start by picking a format. You can use a free resume template like [this one.](http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/)

2. Start filling in the sections. [This template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nN8ruroM-Msu8zyFz9rQlzoCjzv6GD5YI8PzP9DJTKc/edit) should you a good idea of what content to include. (Warning: the content in that example is good, but its format is terrible. Don't make your resume look like this.)

The next steps involve subjecting your resume to multiple rounds of review. 🚨🚨 **Don't skip any of these steps, even if some of them overlap with each other:**

3. Navigate to [this link](https://medium.com/@avishalom/resume-mistake-bingo-c08df472976e). Go through all 24 mistakes on the list and **eliminate them from your resume.**

4. Navigate to [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e). Go through all 4 mistakes on the list and **eliminate them from your resume.**

5. Scroll back up to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes I've listed (😑, ☠️) and **eliminate them from your resume.**

6. Scroll back up _again_ to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the improvements I've listed (🙌, 🎉) and **add them to your resume.**

7. Post your resume to the [#roastmyresume](https://sm-mentorship.slack.com/messages/CG8T413BM/) channel on SharpestMinds Slack and let us tear it apart!

8. As your _last_ step, ask your mentor to take a look at your resume and offer some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**[Here's an example of a great resume. (Thanks, Pierre Damiba! 🙌)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EiRnV15xcVvhSojNNO4J0WFNvR_VWQmK)**

**Why you're doing it:** If you're trying to get your first job in data science or ML, your resume might be the single most important document you'll create to help you do that. It's worth spending lots of time on it to make it good.

## Your LinkedIn profile

You probably have a LinkedIn account already. If you don't have one yet, get one.

**What to do:** Create or polish your LinkedIn account. You should think about your LinkedIn profile the same way an ambitious person thinks about what to wear in an office: _dress for the job you want, not the job you have._

Here's a list of mistakes I see often in LinkedIn profiles. I've rated these mistakes as either 😑 (annoying) or ☠️ (deadly). Some of the mistakes are the same as the ones in the resume section and some are different. To avoid:

- Spelling mistakes ☠️
- Weird capitalization of your own name, e.g., "BOB JOHNSON" ☠️
- **Not** having a profile picture 😑
- Having a profile picture that looks like a mugshot ☠️
- Gaps in your timeline of education or experience 😑
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" 😑
- Mentioning your experience in "IT" (say "software engineering" instead, or another synonym if it applies) ☠️
- Calling yourself an "aspiring" data scientist ☠️
- Having recently commented on someone else's LinkedIn post along the lines of "I sent you a message yesterday. Please respond!!!" Your comment history is **immediately** visible on your profile and this makes you look desperate ☠️
- Long taglines in your profile, e.g., "Graduated | Actively looking for openings in startups and internships | Software, Machine learning, IT, Data Analyst" ☠️

And here's a list of ways of strengthening your LinkedIn profile. Many of these are the same as for your resume; some are solid (🙌) and some are amazing (🎉). Do these all:

- Give yourself a tagline that looks like a job title, e.g., "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", or "Machine Learning Researcher", depending on what describes your project best 🎉
- Make sure you're smiling in your profile picture 🙌
- Have an About section 🎉
- Use "I" language in your About section. Example: "I'm a data scientist who loves working on real world problems that catch my interest. A few things I've worked on: a recommender system for food based on genome, a fake news detection model that beats the state of the art, a fullstack iOS app for an amazing ecommerce company that eventually drove 30% of all sales." 🙌
- In your About section, list a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series). Recruiters will find you based on these keywords! 🎉
- Include SharpestMinds in your experience, [using the same format as for your resume](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) 🎉
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading 🙌
- Write in short sentences, with one idea per sentence 🎉

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a LinkedIn profile, skip the first step.)

1.  Create your [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profile. Make sure it's connected to an email account that you check regularly.

The next steps involve subjecting your LinkedIn to multiple rounds of review. 🚨🚨 **Don't skip any of these steps, even if some of them overlap with each other:**

2. Scroll back up to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes I've listed (😑, ☠️) and **eliminate them from your resume.**

3. Scroll back up _again_ to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the improvements I've listed (🙌, 🎉) and **add them to your resume.**

4. As your _last_ step, ask your mentor to take a look at your LinkedIn and offer you some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**[Here's an example of a great LinkedIn profile. (Thanks, Swapnil Joshi! 🙌)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapnilrjoshi/)**

**Why you're doing it:** You're going to be reaching out to hiring managers and CEOs on LinkedIn _a lot_. When you do, those hiring managers and CEOs will look at your profile as the first thing they do. So make sure it's bulletproof!

## Your Twitter account

Twitter isn't essential, but it can be very useful. The key is to follow insightful people in your industry and engage with them. This is a long-term strategy: it works well, but can take several months.

**What to do:** Get a Twitter account and start following interesting people. Here's a few people we find interesting that you can start with:
- [@DavidDuvenaud](https://twitter.com/DavidDuvenaud), creator of neural ODEs
- [@geoffreyhinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton), godfather of deep learning
- [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward), founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)
- [@math_rachel](https://twitter.com/math_rachel), founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)
- [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval), founder of AngelList
- [@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11), software engineer at Stripe
- [@paulg](https://twitter.com/paulg), founder of Y Combinator

You can also follow us! [@neutronsNeurons](https://twitter.com/neutronsNeurons) [@jeremiecharris](https://twitter.com/jeremiecharris) [@russ_poll](https://twitter.com/russ_poll)

**Avoid** following media organizations or political accounts. These are a huge distraction if you're trying to use Twitter professionally. If you _absolutely must_ follow a political account for some reason, mute them so their tweets don't show up in your timeline.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and sign up for an account. Skip the step where Twitter suggests people and news organizations to follow. These are usually terrible suggestions.

2. Add a profile picture. Make it the same one you use on LinkedIn.

3. Follow a handful of interesting people in startups and/or machine learning. I recommend starting from the list in **What to do**, above, and letting your interests develop naturally from there.

4. Send out 10-15 tweets (or just retweet things that interesting people have said) so your profile doesn't look empty.

**Why you're doing it:** It might sound strange, but Startup Twitter is a place where more interesting ideas are discussed per minute than anywhere else on the Internet. It can also become an incredible source of deep professional connections. Follow enough interesting people, and you'll truly get to know them.

# Job search, part 2: job application strategy

## What job search strategy should I use?

It depends. Here are the possibilities:

### 1) You live in a major tech hub

This is a city with a very high concentration of AI jobs and talent, and where SM has a strong presence in the local community.

**How to tell if you live in a major tech hub**

You're in a major tech hub if you live in one of these 3 areas:

- The Greater Toronto Area :city_sunrise:
- The San Francisco Bay Area :bridge_at_night:
- The Greater New York City Area :statue_of_liberty:

or you're close enough to one of them that you're able to spend a couple of evenings a week there.

**What to do if you live in a major tech hub**

- You should be spending about 60% of your search time [in meetups](#how-to-apply-offline), and the rest [doing cold outreach online.](#how-to-apply-online)
- You should contact a SharpestMinds admin, who may be able to put you in touch with contacts we have in the community.
- It's very likely, but not guaranteed, that you'll be able to find a job close to where you live.

### 2) You live in a minor tech hub

This is a city that has a vibrant tech scene and a decent number of AI opportunities, but less so than a major hub. SM may or may not have a presence here.

**How to tell if you live in a minor tech hub**

For our purposes, there's a simple way to check:

1. [Search for tech events in your city on Meetup.com.](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/tech/) Make sure the city in the search bar is correct.

2. Scroll down and look at the titles of the meetups.

3. Do you see at least 3-4 meetups in the next month on the topics of AI, data science, ML, or data engineering? You do? Then you live in a minor tech hub.

**What to do if you live in a minor tech hub**

- You should spend as much of your search time as possible [in meetups](#how-to-apply-offline). Depending one the tech density in your city, this will range from 10% to 50% of your search time.
- You should spend the rest of your search time [doing cold outreach online.](#how-to-apply-online)
- You should contact a SharpestMinds admin. We have contacts in some local meetup communities, so it's worth asking us.
- You may be able to find a job close to where you live, but you should definitely be open to moving if you get an onsite offer elsewhere.

### 3) You live somewhere else

If you live somewhere that isn't either a major or minor tech hub, that means you won't be able to rely on meetups as part of your job search strategy.

**What to do if you don't live in a tech hub**

- You should spend all of your search time applying online, but not through job boards - [apply the right way.](#how-to-apply-online)
- You should **not** expect that you'll be able to find a job close to where you live. Be open to moving elsewhere for work.

## How to apply offline

The meetup strategy is the strategy that takes the longest to convert. But minute-for-minute, it's easily the most effective. If you live in a [major](#1-you-live-in-a-major-tech-hub) or [minor](#2-you-live-in-a-minor-tech-hub) tech hub, there's no excuse not to use it.

**What to do:** Attend as many _high-quality_ data science-related meetups in your area as you can. Even if you have to commute for an hour to get to the meetup, it can be worth it if the meetup is good enough.

High-quality meetups have most of the following properties:

- They're **technically focused.** This ensures that less competent people drop out quickly from boredom. Research paper or project presentations are good. "Introduction to Python for Data Science" is bad.

- They **recur often.** This lets you get to know the community faster. Every week is great. Every month is fine.

- They have **medium attendance.** The meetup should be small enough to be intimate, but big enough that you don't run out of people to talk to. 10-60 people attending is ideal. (That's not "10-60 people signed up on meetup.com". It's "10-60 asses in seats at the meetup".)

**How to do it:**

**First,** you need to figure out what the good meetups are in your area. There are two possibilities:

A) **You live in a [major tech hub](#1-you-live-in-a-major-tech-hub):** Contact an admin. We'll send you a list of the meetups you should attend and instructions on how to join them. (Some of the best meetup groups in these cities aren't open to the public.)

B) **You live in a [minor tech hub](#2-you-live-in-a-minor-tech-hub) or [somewhere else](#3-you-live-somewhere-else):**

1. [Go to meetup.com and search for tech meetups near your area.](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/tech/) Make sure the city in the search bar is right.

2. Start going to meetups. Start by casting a wide net: go to as many data science-related meetups as you can. It's very hard to tell which ones are good without going there in person.

3. Stop going to the lame meetups. After you've been to a few, the lame meetups will seem lame; stop going to them. If you aren't sure, evaluate the meetups using the criteria in the **What to do** section above.

  If you're in a small enough city, it's possible that all the meetups in your area will be lame. If so, you won't be able to use the meetup strategy.

**Second,** you need to start networking. Here's how to do that:

1. The question you should always be asking yourself at a meetup is this:

    **"How can I learn as much as I possibly can about people's problems that I find interesting, and offer as much help as I possibly can to those people in solving their problems?"**

    You can mess up a lot of things, but if you apply this mentality to everyone you talk to, doors will start opening for you. Every step after this is just tactical advice to get you to talk to more people.

2. Go to your first meetup. If you feel nervous about meeting people, set yourself the goal of "just going".

3. If you're shy in person, set yourself a goal to intro yourself to at least one attendee. At the next meetup increase this goal to two, then three.

4. If you go to a meetup and someone presents a technical topic, a great way to start conversations afterwards is to _ask questions_ during the presentation. (Just do it politely, and make sure they're good questions.)

5. Once you've discovered which meetups are good, _keep attending them_. See the **Why you're doing it** section below for why this is important.

6. If you've been doing a project during your mentorship, and if you've been to a meetup a few times, ask the organizer if he'd be interested in having you present your project. **Don't feel shy about doing this!** Most meetup organizers lie awake at night thinking of how to fill their meetups with content. You're giving them what they need.

7. Remember: _Ask people what their problems are and listen to them when they tell you!_ This is the essence of real networking.

    Nobody cares about your problems. So if you want someone's attention, you need to care about their problems. (Later, once you've become wealthy and/or powerful, you'll suddenly discover that other people have started to care about your problems.)

**Why you're doing it:**

We've studied meetups extensively as a source of job leads. It's important to remember that the value you'll get from attending a meetup series compounds over time. It also compounds over different meetups across the same area, since the same people often go to multiple meetups.

Meeting Bob from Google for the first time at Meetup X is fine. Meeting Bob for the sixth time at Meetup X is great. Meeting Bob at Meetup Y after you've already met him at Meetup X is fantastic.

It will take you time to build up equity and trust in a meetup community. But after you've built up a head of steam it's one of the best possible uses of your time. We recommend prioritizing this for anyone who lives in an AI hub, or even a second tier city that has at least one good meetup series that meets regularly.

## How to apply online

The right way to apply online is **not** through job boards. The right way to apply online is to cold email specific individual people inside a company. This section will tell you exactly how to do that.

**Note: The following advice applies best to companies that are ~500 employees or less. Applying to bigger companies takes a different strategy.**

**What to do:** I'm going to take you through a systematic strategy of email outreach. A few things to note about this before we start:

- You should apply online using cold email, _not_ using a job board
- If you ignore this advice and apply through a job board anyway, use cold email on a company _first, and only then_ apply to that company through a job board
-  You can expect a response rate of 20-30% on a good cold email
- You can expect a response rate of 1-2% applying through a job board if you have a good resume

**How to do it:** You're going to be running a process. The output of that process will be an email sent to someone in a company that's hiring for ML or data science.

A realistic target if you're actively applying for jobs is ~3 of these emails per day. As you get better at writing them, you'll find it easier to send more.

**Step 0: Before you begin:**

1. [Download Streak for gmail.](https://www.streak.com) Streak is a free browser extension that lets you see if an email you sent has been opened or not.

2. [Install Sapling.ai.](https://sapling.ai) Sapling is a free browser extension (Chrome only) that is specifically designed to automatically proofread emails for you. It is _very_ effective.

3. [Install Snov.io.](https://snov.io) Snov is a freemium browser extension (Chrome only) that lets you find someone's email if you know their name and their company. You'll probably only need the free version.

**Step 1: Find companies that have roles you're interested in**

1. Go on LinkedIn and search for "hiring data". Make sure to filter for `People`. You'll get a hits for people who are hiring data scientists, data engineers, and all kinds of other data roles. (You can search for "hiring machine learning" or "hiring `X`" to get similar results for roles in `X`.)

2. You can also look on job boards to find open positions - just don't use job boards to apply. Good job boards you can use to search:

3. The best thing to do is to create a spreadsheet to list the companies that are hiring that you want to apply to. Start with ~10 companies on your spreadsheet to get used to the reach-out process. You can add more later on.

**Step 2: Find people in those companies who are hiring:**

The second step is to find people who are actively hiring for their companies.

**For companies of ~100 employees or less, the person you should contact is the company's CEO.** It might seem scary to email a CEO directly, but you should understand that CEOs are in charge of the overall hiring objectives for their companies.

If you send a CEO an email that makes you seem like a promising candidate for one of their open positions, you are helping that CEO with one of their key objectives. You are doing them a favor. (But CEOs tend to be busy, so don't take it personally if not everyone responds.)

Most startup CEOs make themselves deliberately accessible over email. In fact, a startup CEO's email is usually `{CEO's first name}@{company domain}`. For example, my own company email is `edouard[at]sharpestminds[dot]com`. It's easy to guess, because I _want_ interested people to contact me.

There are two big advantages to emailing a founder-CEO. First, _it's easy to find common ground with them._ You already know something the founder-CEO is passionate about: their company! After all, they wouldn't have founded that company if they weren't passionate about its mission. If you write an email that shows you're passionate about their company's mission too, they'll definitely pay attention. Finding someone with a sincere interest in your company - beyond just "I want a job" - is rarer than it seems.

The second advantage of emailing a CEO is that _they can order a hiring manager to talk to you._ We're all human, and people tend to value their own time more than other people's. If you email a hiring manager directly, they have to decide right then if you're worth spending 30 minutes of _their own time_ (which they value a lot) talking to. But if you email the CEO, the CEO only has to decide if you're worth spending 30 minutes of _their hiring manager's time_ (which they value less) talking to. As you can imagine, they're much more likely to say yes.

And when a hiring manager gets an email from their CEO saying "you should talk to Bob", they pretty much have to talk to Bob.

**For companies of ~100-500 employees, the person you should contact is the company's VP of Engineering.** Same rules apply as for the CEO above.

# Checklist: at a networking event or job fair

1. You should be mostly trying to talk to companies that you superficially fit with. i.e., there's a crude label you can give yourself in a quick conversation that makes you seem like you'd be _unusually_ suited to work at that company. It doesn't have to be an exact fit, just something that signal-boosts you vs. all the other junior applicants who won't be using this strategy.

2. Example: suppose you're a former controls engineer. Then you can mentally label yourself with the keywords, e.g., "controls & industrial engineering". And therefore, you should be targeting companies like [Canvass](https://www.canvass.io) (industrial IoT), [Quartic.ai](http://quartic.ai) (smart manufacturing), and [SolidState](https://www.solidstate.ai) (process optimization for chip manufacturing). Everyone has at least one label they can use; many have several. If you're not sure what yours is/are, message an admin and we can help you figure it out!

3. When talking to a company rep at a job fair, remember that you're the 50th of 100 people they'll be talking to that day. Your label / keyword is the most information you can reasonably expect them to retain about you. So make it stick!

4. People are much more interested in their own problem than in yours. So ask them what their problems are!

5. When you talk to someone, get their business card and add them to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is key, because otherwise they'll forget the link between your name and your face. Make sure your LinkedIn has an up to date profile photo that looks like you.

6. Reach out to them after the event ends, and _follow up_. Expect to have to follow up an _anomalously high_ number of times. Networking events always generate a ton of connections for everybody, most of which go nowhere. Personalize your follow ups. They don't remember you, _but you should remember them_ - that's how you stand out!

# Checklist: how to network on LinkedIn

1. **For most people**, there isn't any value in collecting random LinkedIn connections if you don't know them and they don't know you. You should connect with someone on LinkedIn if you, at a minimum: a) have met them in person, or 2) have already had 2-way communication with them some other way (email, Twitter, etc.).

2. If you want to follow someone's posts on LinkedIn (e.g., [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/)), don't connect with them; *follow* them.

3. While you should never try to connect with *random* people you don't know, it can be a good idea to connect with *specific* people you don't know. For example, if someone is a hiring manager at a company you want to work at, it can be a good idea to connect with them. The points below explain how to do that.

4. Here's the situation. Suppose you really want to get hired at Uber Data Science in Seattle. You're being mentored by, e.g., a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte.

5. Start by searching for folks who work at Uber DS in Seattle on LinkedIn. Identify their Twitter accounts, Medium blogs, any online presence by any of them. Engage with them personally as much as possible - smart, positive comments on Twitter, Medium posts, etc. Do that for at least 1 week with as many of them as possible.

6. Then, connect with as many as you can on LinkedIn with a personal, customized message ideally that references other stuff they've written online. People *love it* when you quote their own insights back to them.

7. Once you're connected and you can message them without character limits, try to start a conversation. The trick is, don't ask for something - *offer* something. One good strategy is to combine an idea with an implied compliment. Example: I'm working on this data science project with a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte (instant signal of high value). I had `this thought / idea / insight`, I've been following your work for the last little while, and been really impressed, and I'd really value your thoughts on it.

8. This says to me: 1) A Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte thinks you're a valuable enough person to spend time working on a project with, so you must be valuable. 2) You think independently, since you've had this insight. 3) you've been following my work on the Internet and despite having access to a Senior DS at Deloitte you respect my work so much that you think I'm worth reaching out to about this.

9. Do this with a small handful of people at first, and you're almost guaranteed to start a productive conversation with at least one of them.

10. **Important:** Don't send generic messages to a ton of people. Impersonal LinkedIn spam will *only* damage your reputation. When in doubt, ask yourself: Does this message make it obvious that I've spent more than 5 minutes investigating this person's online presence? If the answer isn't "heck yes", then keep working on your message.

# Checklist: how to apply

1. If there's a specific company you're interested in working with, and that company has open source projects on GitHub, it's a *very* good idea to contribute to their open source codebases. For example, if you really wanted to be hired by Uber, you could contribute to [this project](https://github.com/uber/ludwig). If you have a contribution accepted, you can and should list this on your resume under a section like "Open Source Contributions".

# Checklist: how to interview

1. To prepare for the interview, follow the advice at the end of [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996). It's geared to software engineering, but can be easily adapted to ML / data science.

2. To prepare for the interview, use the Briefcase Technique - [described in this blog post.](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/the-briefcase-technique/) It's especially useful if there's one company that you _really_ want to work at and you get an interview. (Ignore the marketing-speak in the linked blogpost, the technique works and that's what matters.)

3. To **practice** interviewing, there are two resources you can use. First, you can message an admin on Slack and ask to be connected to another mentee for practice interviews. Second, you can use [pramp](https://www.pramp.com/). Pramp (short for PRActice Makes Perfect) is a free interview prep service that pairs you with interviewers to practice job interviews. Recommended by one of our mentors! 👍

4. Find out who is going to be interviewing you, then look them up on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Most questions in interviews have many correct answers, so the more context you have on your interviewer, the better you'll be able to predict which correct answers they're looking for! **Elite tip:** It can be a great idea to quote some of their own insights back at them, if they've written in blogs or on Twitter.

5. During the interview, you might get asked if you have any questions for the interviewer about the team or the organization. [Here's a great list of questions you can ask](https://doctorj.gitlab.io/interview-questions/); pick a few you find most interesting.

6. Getting no follow up after an interview is _not unusual_ - in this or in any other activity where you're selling yourself. Remember that you're playing a numbers game: each time you practice the technical interview your odds for the next time around go up.

7. If you don't hear back from the interviewer: follow up with them 2-3 times by email (once every 2-3 days) with a simple, polite request for feedback. If you can combine that with a thought or a suggestion that would help their business (e.g., "I was thinking about the way you model sales for widgets, and it occurred to me that you might get better performance if you used model X instead of model Y because of Z"), that's :100:.

8. Your frame of mind is: you are a person who can add significant value to their business. If they don't want you, no problem: you will find another business and you will add value over there instead. There's no emotional component to the decision from either side; it's just business.

9. To keep your energy high, _focus on the process, not the goal_. Allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment when you learn things that improve your process for applying / interviewing / etc.
**Focus on the inputs and the output will come eventually** :muscle:.

10. In other words: learn as much as you can from each no, then deliberately move on. **It doesn't matter how many nos you get.** All that matters is that one of them is a yes. And that will happen!!!

# 🌍 If you are **not** a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident

If you aren't a resident of either the USA or Canada, you might need a permit or a work visa to get a job in either country.

If you want to work in the USA, you'll probably need an H1B visa. Getting one is hard, and it's gotten harder recently. It also restricts your options to only applying to companies that sponsor H1B. It doesn't cost a company that much (~$5k) but not all of them sponsor H1B because it can sometimes take up to 6 months for one to get approved.

If you'd like to work in the USA eventually, you should seriously think about first working in Canada, building up a year's experience, and only then going back and applying for jobs in the USA. Not only will you be in less of a rush that way, you'll also have the leverage that comes from having 1+ years of industry experience. In fact, some employers don't sponsor visas for junior engineers, but do sponsor them for mid and senior level engineers. That means you'll have more options if you're in the latter category.

If you're trying to get a job in Canada, the visa process is a lot easier. Canada has a program called the Global Talent Stream (GTS), which is designed to bring highly skilled international talent into the country. The GTS is similar to the H1B, except that there are no quotas and you can get approved for one in 5-10 business days instead of six months. You do need to get a job that has a minimum annual salary; you can find out what that minimum is [at this website](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/227159).

### SharpestMinds deals for international residents

If you're an international resident trying to get a job in Canada, SharpestMinds can help you in two ways:

1. We have a deal with [MaRS](https://www.marsdd.com), a Canadian government/industry organization. Under our deal, MaRS staff will personally support any SharpestMinds student in navigating Canada's GTS visa system. But more than that: **MaRS will also handle the GTS application process for any company that hires one of our grads!** Make sure to mention this if you're interviewing at a Canadian company, because they need to know this before the offer stage. Having MaRS handle their application process probably saves them ~$4k in legal fees they'd otherwise have to pay if they hired you.

   How do you bring up this deal during an interview? Try saying something like: "If `[company name]` is open to hiring through the  Global Talent Stream, I'm part of a program that covers the legal work to file an application for any company that hires me through GTS, at zero cost except the government filing fee. I can put you in touch with them if you want." If they ask for more information, you can tell them what's on this page, or even refer them to this repo if that's easier. And of course, you can connect them to an admin, who will answer their questions and connect them to the MaRS team.

2. We also have an agreement with [GlobalSkills.io](http://globalskills.io), a recruiting company that places internationals at Canadian companies through GTS. If you're international, they can connect you to their hiring partners and help their partners with the GTS application process.

Both of the deals above are free for you to use, so take advantage of them! To redeem either deal, DM an admin on SharpestMinds Slack and we'll get you set up.

# Random FAQ

### What if I don't know what career path to follow?

Use the Waterloo strategy. Here's what that is: (1) you work at a tiny startup that can't afford anyone better; (2) you work at a BigCo or consulting firm like KPMG or Oracle; (3) you work at a startup at Series A or Series B; (4) you work at Google or Facebook; (5) you work wherever you want.

### I just got a job offer. Should I negotiate the salary?

Yes!!! The moment you get a job offer, **contact an admin** and we'll give you advice to help you negotiate the salary number.

### What kinds of meetups should I go to for networking?

Most meetups you go to will be a waste of time, but when you're starting you should go to all of them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. The good ones will (1) be **technical**; (2) be **small**; and (3) **repeat often** (e.g. once a week). If you can't get all 3, then prioritize (1) and (3). A meetup that repeats often means you'll build long term relationships with the participants, many of whom will be hiring managers you want to work for.

This strategy is way more successful than going to one-off "networking" events. Real networking is more than adding someone on LinkedIn: it's about building relationships that compound over time. The sooner you start, the better.

### How can I tell if a company's ML team is actually good?

Evaluating the work of a company's ML/DS team from the outside can be irreducibly hard. Usually, you can't assess the quality of their work upfront because as an outsider you can see neither the inputs nor the outputs. My best advice is: ask them during the interview. Try to figure out what goes in, what comes out, how the pipeline is organized, and then ask yourself if it all seems reasonable.

We also try to help with this problem by giving companies technical ratings in our hiring partners list, [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee-resources). (Note: missing ratings don't necessarily mean we thing a company is bad, just that we may lack information.)

### How do I follow up on an intro email?

Here's a great phrase one of our earliest mentees used to use after getting an email intro from us to company XYZ:
> Can you tell me more about what XYZ co is up to? What's the tightest bottleneck at the moment?

^ What a great line! It shows he's zeroing in right away on what's most important _to them_. Use it! (Adapt the wording to suit your personality. You may also have to substitute "XYZ co" for "your team at XYZ co" if XYZ co is bigger than ~20 employees.)

Here's an example of an incredibly good followup to an intro email. **Your followup should probably be shorter than this**, but I like this one as an example because it nails everything you might want to say in a followup.

> Hi Edouard,
> Thanks for the intro!
> (moved to BCC)

> Hi `[name]`,
> It's great to meet you! 

> I read a few online articles about your mission with `[company name]`, but it was your Quora post that really helped a lot of my thoughts and ideas coalesce into more definite questions.

> For example, what makes a person interesting, and how can you quantify whether someone would fit in a certain group? What are the best ways to facilitate meaningful interactions between humans and what are good metrics to quantify how successful the interaction was? How can a social network scale without diluting the essence of what makes it so fun? `[NOTE: These   questions are specific to the company, which is a special kind of social network.]`

> I'm pretty excited about the approach `[company name]` has taken to address these complicated and fascinating questions, and I would love to talk about what I can offer to help your mission.

> A little more about me: I'm a painter (mostly watercolor), as well as a data scientist. Given these two interests, my specialty lies in taking numbers and functions and turning them into visually appealing images that convey complex ideas in a simple, and visually appealing manner.  I also have a passion for both communicating and absorbing new ideas.

> If you want to learn a little more about me I have a website where you can find a blog post about me, as well as other posts about code I've written: `[link to website]`

> My current project, with a SharpestMinds mentor, is taking some medium size (~7 GB, 40 columns) data and feeding it into machine learning models to predict changes in customer behavior. 

> I'm pretty excited to take the skills and knowledge I have and apply them to helping to build a great social networking platform for `[company name]`. I would love to schedule a phone call to chat a bit about what I can offer to you, and to see if I would be a good fit on your team.

> Best,

### Is there anything different about being a data scientist at a small (~20 employee) company?

Yes. I won't be able to do any better at explaining this than to point you to [this Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c).

### If I'm given a take home test with no deadline, how long should I take to submit it?

Here's some advice from our mentors:

> There is always a deadline. If not mentioned, ask for it. Many peope think that if you have a FT job and turn the assignment in less than a day, you are taking time off your current job which is a red flag.

> It's totally up to the employer. (...) For the problems with no deadline, spend as much time as you need to. They're more concerned about the quality and how you answer the question than handing it in as soon as possible.

In other words: it depends. When in doubt, ask your mentor or message an admin on Slack.

### Do I have to apply to jobs on my own, or does SharpestMinds refer to me companies?

Both. We can (and do) refer you to companies directly, but you absolutely need to continue applying on your own - otherwise you'll miss out on a ton of opportunities that you'd otherwise get to see.

But our hiring network gives you a second advantage beyond direct referrals. When you apply to companies in our network and get turned down, it's often possible for us to discover the real reason why. In normal cases, when you apply for a position and get turned down, you'll never find out why. But when you apply to companies on our network, we're often able to use our personal relationships with them to get feedback that helps you improve your next application.

The best way to think about it is this: your job is to keep applying to positions, and our job is to increase the chances of each application leading to a high-paying job offer.

### How do I add SharpestMinds to my resume?

You should mention your mentor's name and company (unless your mentor asks you not to), so that their prestige will rub off on you. We'll continue to support you even after your mentorship ends, so it's correct to say on your resume that you're still at SharpestMinds, even if your mentorship term has ended. Here's an example of how to include SharpestMinds on your resume:

   ![How to include SharpestMinds on your resume](https://github.com/sharpest-minds/hiring-tips/blob/master/img/sm-in-resume.png)

**Important:** If you haven't been in the program very long (2 months or less), you should title this, e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer (Project)" instead of just "Machine Learning Engineer". If recruiters see you've only been a Data Scientist for a month, they may wonder why you're trying to switch jobs so soon!
