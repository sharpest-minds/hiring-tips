# Special deals

1. We have a deal with [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) to give every mentee $50 in free GPU credits. Use them! To get your credits, message an admin on Slack or post to the mentees channel.

2. You can also get $300 in free GCP credits (any service) via their [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

# Job search, part 1: creating first impressions

[In Part 2,](#job-search-part-2-job-application-strategy) I'll cover how to reach out to companies in your job search. But before you do that, you need to prepare the way for yourself. In this part I'll cover how to curate your online presence to make your value obvious to companies.

The more obviously valuable you are, the more likely that companies will answer when you reach out to them, and the easier they'll be to negotiate with. For the kinds of jobs we're interested in, you'll need to mare sure your [resume](#your-resume), your [LinkedIn](#your-linkedin-profile), and your [GitHub](#your-github-profile) are flawless 👌. Having [a personal website](#your-personal-website-and-email-address) will also help you **a lot**, but you can probably find a job even if you don't have one.

If you follow the advice in this section properly, you might find that recruiters start to reach out to you. If that happens, don't let it go to your head. By itself, a recruiter reaching out isn't that valuable. Just think of it as a sign you're on the right track.

## Your resume

Once you're experienced, your resume won't matter that much. But when you're breaking into an industry, it matters a lot. It's worth putting a _significant amount of work_ into making sure your resume is excellent.

Some resume mistakes can kill an application completely. **Spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistakes are deadly** because hiring managers interpret them as meaning that you lack attention to detail. That isn't fair, particularly if English isn't your first language. But it's the way it is.

**What to do:** Put together or update your resume. Make sure it's geared towards data science roles.

Here's a list of common mistakes I see in resumes, plus a rating of how bad they are, either 😑 (annoying) or ☠️ (deadly). Avoid them:

- Spelling mistakes ☠️
- Inconsistent formatting 😑
- So much text I can't get through it to read the important parts 😑
- Including a picture of yourself 😑
- Gaps in your timeline so I can't tell what you were doing during some time period ☠️
- Not ordering your timeline chronologically 😑
- Listing Microsoft Office / Excel as one of your skills ☠️
- Listing MNIST, the Titanic dataset, or another generic project in your list of projects ☠️
- Submitting your resume in any format other than a PDF ☠️
- Including a detailed description of your graduate thesis if it isn't directly ML-related 😑
- Including a list of publications if they aren't ML-related 😑
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" 😑
- Having a resume that is 1 page long plus one sentence, instead of _either_ 1 page long or 1.5-2 pages long 😑

And here's a list of things you can do to make your resume stronger, with a rating of how good they are, either 🙌 (solid) or 🎉 (amazing). Do all of these:

- [Include SharpestMinds in your resume under Experience](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) 🙌
- Make sure your Skills section is at the top of the resume 🙌
- Divide your skills into "Advanced" skills and "Experience with" skills 🙌
- If you've had technical or business jobs before, list your dollar contributions to them (e.g., increase revenues by X%, reduced costs by $Y) 🎉
- In your Skills section, list a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series) 🙌
- Provide GitHub links to your best projects 🎉
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading 🎉
- Make sure your writing is clear and concise. Use short sentences, with one idea per sentence 🎉

> 👉 **Also highly recommended:** [_The 4 fastest ways not to get hired as a data scientist_](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e) by [Jeremie Harris](http://twitter.com/jeremiecharris). The four most deadly mistakes you can make on your resume.

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a resume, skip the first 2 steps.)

1.  Start by picking a format. You can use a free resume template like [this one.](http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/)

2. Start filling in the sections. [This template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nN8ruroM-Msu8zyFz9rQlzoCjzv6GD5YI8PzP9DJTKc/edit) should you a good idea of what content to include. (Warning: the content in that example is good, but its format is terrible. Don't make your resume look like this.)

3. (Optional) If you're brave enough, post your resume to the [#roastmyresume](https://sm-mentorship.slack.com/messages/CG8T413BM/) channel on SharpestMinds Slack and let us tear it apart!

4. Scroll to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes (😑, ☠️) and improvements (🙌, 🎉) I've listed. Eliminate the mistakes, and add the improvements.

5. As your _last_ step, you can ask your mentor to take a look at your resume and offer some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**[Here's an example of a great resume. (Thanks, Pierre Damiba! 🙌)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EiRnV15xcVvhSojNNO4J0WFNvR_VWQmK)**

**[And here's another excellent resume. (Thanks, Perry Johnson! 🙌)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mSchLDG8qXqExpbqWeNZ1Q_QCJvPk5Ep)**

**Why you're doing it:** If you're trying to get your first job in data science or ML, your resume will be the most important single document you create. It's worth spending time on.

## Your LinkedIn profile

You probably have a LinkedIn account already. If you don't have one yet, get one.

**What to do:** Create or update your LinkedIn account. You should think about your LinkedIn profile the same way an ambitious person thinks about what to wear in an office: _dress for the job you want, not the job you have._

Here's a list of mistakes I see often in LinkedIn profiles. I've rated these mistakes as either 😑 (annoying) or ☠️ (deadly):

- Spelling mistakes ☠️
- Weird capitalization of your own name, e.g., "BOB JOHNSON" or "bob johnson" ☠️
- **Not** having a profile picture 😑
- Having a profile picture that looks like a mugshot ☠️
- Gaps in your timeline of education or experience 😑
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" 😑
- Saying you have experience in "IT" (say "software engineering" instead, or another synonym) ☠️
- Calling yourself an "aspiring" data scientist ☠️
- Having a recent comment on _someone else's_ LinkedIn post along the lines of "I sent you a message yesterday. Please respond!!!" Your comment history is **immediately** visible on your profile and this makes you look desperate ☠️
- Long taglines in your profile, e.g., "Graduated | Actively looking for openings in startups and internships | Software, Machine learning, IT, Data Analyst" ☠️

And here's a list of ways of strengthening your LinkedIn profile. Some are solid (🙌) and some are amazing (🎉):

- Give yourself a tagline that looks like a job title, e.g., "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", or "Machine Learning Researcher", depending on what describes you best 🎉
- Make sure you're smiling in your profile picture 🙌
- Have an About section 🎉
- Use "I" language in your About section. Example: "I'm a data scientist who loves working on real world problems that catch my interest. A few things I've worked on: a recommender system for food based on genome, a fake news detection model that beats the state of the art, a full stack iOS app for an amazing e-commerce company that eventually drove 30% of all sales." 🎉
- In your About section, list a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series). Recruiters will find you based on these keywords! 🎉
- Include SharpestMinds in your experience, [using the same format as for your resume](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) 🙌
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading 🙌
- Write in short sentences, with one idea per sentence 🎉

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a LinkedIn profile, skip the first step.)

1.  Create your [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profile. Make sure it's connected to an email account that you check regularly.

2. Scroll to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes (😑, ☠️) and improvements (🙌, 🎉) I've listed. Eliminate the mistakes, and add the improvements.

3. As your _last_ step, you can ask your mentor to take a look at your LinkedIn and offer you some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**[Here's an example of a great LinkedIn profile. (Thanks, Swapnil Joshi! 🙌)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapnilrjoshi/)**

**Why you're doing it:** You're going to be reaching out to a lot of hiring managers and CEOs on LinkedIn. When you do, the first thing those hiring managers and CEOs will do is look at your LinkedIn profile.

## Your GitHub profile

GitHub is where you show off the substance of the projects you've worked on; not just explaining them, but showing the quality of your code. :octocat:

**What to do:** If you don't have a GitHub account, get one. Don't feel bad if it's empty at first. It's _far_ better to have a single project that you're diving deep on than to have 20 projects that are all forks with 1 commit each.

Here's a list of mistakes I see often in GitHub profiles. I've rated these mistakes as either 😑 (annoying) or ☠️ (deadly):

- Not having a profile picture of yourself 😑
- Having a bunch of forked repos that you haven't made commits to in your Overview ☠️
- Having only trivial projects (e.g., Titanic dataset, MNIST) in your Overview ☠️
- The README in your best project is one line long and doesn't explain the project in depth 😑
- Having a tagline in your profile where you call yourself an "aspiring" data scientist ☠️

And here's a list of ways of strengthening your GitHub profile. Some are solid (🙌) and some are amazing (🎉):

- Having a profile picture of yourself that matches the profile pics you use on other professional networks (LinkedIn especially) 🙌
- Only pinning repos to your Overview that you _want_ hiring managers to look at 🎉
- Including README files for each project in your Overview, with clear explanations. This is where to include links to the project's Medium articles, your personal website, or a running version of the project app! 🎉
- If you have a project you're actively working on, include a log in the README of the changes you've made, along with their dates, to give a sense of activity 🎉

**How to do it:**

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, [create one](http://github.com).

2. Add a profile pic of yourself that matches the profile pics you use on other professional networks (LinkedIn especially).

3. Scroll to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes (😑, ☠️) and improvements (🙌, 🎉) I've listed. Eliminate the mistakes, and add the improvements.

4. Add your SharpestMinds mentorship project to your GitHub. This should be one of the projects you're going deep on, so include lots of detail, explanations, and ideally images.

**Why you're doing it:** At some point during your job application process to _any_ company, some technical person is going to look at your GitHub profile.

**[Here's an example of a great GitHub profile. (Thanks, Jamel Thomas! 🙌)](https://github.com/thom1178)**

**[And here's another example of a great GitHub profile. (Thanks, Raj Singh! 🙌)](https://github.com/rajs96)**

## Your personal website and email address

When you apply for jobs, you shouldn't use Yahoo or Hotmail as your email account. Gmail _can be okay_, but **only** if your email address is something like firstname.lastname@gmail.com. It's much better to have an email at your own domain, and to host a personal website at that domain. Your personal website can be very simple, but it does need to exist.

**What to do:** Buy your own domain name and set up a website and email account on it.

If your name is John Q. Smith, your email should be john@jqsmith.com, john@johnqsmith.com or something like that.

Your personal website only needs to have 3.5 things on it:

- Your name.

- A one-line blurb that describes you.

- Links to your other online profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium, etc.).

- (Optional but recommended) A nice picture of yourself.

That's it. You can add other things too, if you want. Just make sure those 3 things are on there.

**How to do it:**
1. The fastest and cheapest way to set up your personal website is using [Google Domains.](https://domains.google/) Just follow the instructions in the link, and you can buy a domain name, website hosting, and personalized email domain for a few dollars a month.
2. Once you've done this, add a link to your personal website to your email signature.

**[Here's an example of a great personal website. (Thanks, Phil Glazer! 🙌)](https://pglazer.com)**

**Why you're doing it:** You'll be doing a lot of cold email outreach to companies when you start looking for jobs. When you do, sending an email from your personal domain gives off a strong positive impression.

If the person who receives your email is even slightly interested in talking to you, there's also a good chance they'll also navigate to your personal website if they see a link to it. This puts you in a strong position because you don't have to sell yourself so hard in your initial email. Your initial email only needs to make them curious; you can let your website do the rest.

## Your Twitter account

Twitter is very useful. The key to getting value from Twitter is to follow insightful people in your industry and engage with them. This is a long-term strategy: it works well, but it can take several months.

**What to do:** Get a Twitter account and start following interesting people. Here's a few people we find interesting that you can start with:
- [@DavidDuvenaud](https://twitter.com/DavidDuvenaud), creator of neural ODEs
- [@geoffreyhinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton), godfather of deep learning
- [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward), founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)
- [@math_rachel](https://twitter.com/math_rachel), founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)
- [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval), founder of AngelList
- [@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11), software engineer at Stripe
- [@paulg](https://twitter.com/paulg), founder of Y Combinator

You can also follow us! [@neutronsNeurons](https://twitter.com/neutronsNeurons) [@jeremiecharris](https://twitter.com/jeremiecharris) [@russ_poll](https://twitter.com/russ_poll)

**Avoid** following media organizations or political accounts. These are a huge distraction if you're trying to use Twitter professionally. If you _absolutely must_ follow a political account for some reason, mute them so their tweets don't show up in your timeline.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and sign up for an account. Skip the step where Twitter suggests people and news organizations to follow. These are usually bad suggestions.

2. Add a profile picture. Make it the same one you use on LinkedIn.

3. Follow a handful of interesting people in startups and/or machine learning. I recommend starting from the list in **What to do**, above, and letting your interests develop naturally from there.

4. It's a good idea to send out 10-15 tweets (or just retweet things that interesting people have said) so your profile doesn't look empty.

**Why you're doing it:** Startup Twitter is a place where more interesting ideas are discussed per minute than anywhere else on the Internet. It can also become an incredible source of deep professional connections. Follow enough interesting people, and you'll truly get to know them.

# Job search, part 2: job application strategy

## What job search strategy should I use?

It depends. Here are the possibilities:

### 1) You live in a tech hub

This is a city that has a tech scene and a decent number of AI opportunities, but less than a major hub. We might or might not know people there.

**How to tell if you live in a tech hub**

Here's how to check:

1. [Search for tech events in your city on Meetup.com.](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/tech/) Make sure the city in the search bar is correct.

2. Scroll down and look at the titles of the meetups.

3. Do you see at least 3-4 meetups in the next month on the topics of AI, data science, ML, or data engineering? You do? Then you live in a tech hub.

**What to do if you live in a tech hub**

- You should spend as much of your search time as possible [in meetups](#how-to-apply-offline), up to a maximum of attending 2-3 meetups per week.
- You should spend the rest of your search time [doing cold email outreach.](#how-to-apply-online)
- You should contact a SharpestMinds admin. We have contacts in some local meetup communities, so it's worth asking us.
- You may be able to find a job close to where you live, but you should be open to moving if you get an onsite offer elsewhere.

### 2) You don't live in a tech hub

If you live somewhere that isn't a tech hub, then you won't be able to rely on meetups in your job search strategy.

**What to do if you don't live in a tech hub**

- You should spend all of your search time applying online, but not through job boards - [apply the right way.](#how-to-apply-online)
- You should **not** expect that you'll be able to find a job close to where you live. Be very open to moving elsewhere for work.

## How to apply offline

The meetup strategy takes time to convert, it's very effective. If you live in a [tech hub](#1-you-live-in-a-tech-hub), you should use it.

> 👉 **Highly recommended reading:** [_How to escape the resume slush pile_](https://datasciencecareermap.com/2019/05/02/how-to-escape-the-resume-slush-pile/) by mentor [Susan Holcomb](https://twitter.com/h0lc0mb). Includes a couple of sections with tips about networking events.

**What to do:** Go to _high-quality_ data science-related meetups in your area. Even if you have to commute for an hour to get to the meetup, it can be worth it, if the meetup is good enough.

High-quality meetups have most of the following properties:

- They're **technically focused.** That ensures less competent people will quickly drop out of the meetup from boredom. Research paper or project presentations are good. "Introduction to Python for Data Science" is bad.

- They **recur regularly.** This lets you get to know the community faster. Every week is great. Every month is fine.

- They have **medium attendance.** The meetup should be small enough to be intimate, but big enough that you don't run out of people to talk to. 10-60 people is ideal. (Note: that isn't "10-60 people signed up on meetup.com". It's "10-60 asses in seats".)

**How to do it:**

**Step 1:** figure out what the good meetups are in your area.

1. [Go to meetup.com and search for tech meetups near your area.](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/tech/) Make sure the city in the search bar is correct.

2. Start going to meetups. At first, go to as many different data science-related meetups as you can. It's hard to tell which ones are good without going in person. Look especially for technical meetups hosted by growing startups who are trying to build a community around themselves.

3. After you've been to a few meetups, you'll know which meetups are the lame ones; so stop going to those. If you aren't sure, evaluate the meetups using the criteria in the **What to do** section above.

  Sometimes, if your city is small, all the meetups in your area might be lame. If that's the case, then unfortunately you won't be able to use this meetup strategy.

**Step 2:** Start networking:

1. The question you should always be asking yourself at a meetup is this:

    **"How can I learn as much as I possibly can about people's problems that I find interesting, and offer as much help as I possibly can to those people in solving their problems?"**

    You can mess up a lot of things, but if you apply that mentality to everyone you talk to, doors will start opening for you. Every step after this is tactical advice to let you talk to more people.

2. Go to your first meetup. If you feel nervous at first, set yourself the goal of "just going". You don't need to talk to anyone at first; just build the habit.

3. If you're shy, set yourself a goal to introduce yourself to at least one attendee. At the next meetup increase this goal to two, then three.

4. If you go to a meetup and someone presents a technical topic, a great way to start conversations afterwards is to _ask questions_ during the presentation. (Just do it politely, and make sure they're good questions.)

5. Once you've discovered which meetups are good, _keep attending them_. See the **Why you're doing it** section below for why this is important.

6. If you've been doing a project during your mentorship, and if you've been to a meetup a few times, ask the organizer if he'd be interested in having you present your project. **Don't feel shy about doing this!** Most meetup organizers lie awake at night thinking of how to fill their meetups with content. You're helping them with their problem.

7. Remember: _Ask people what their problems are and listen to them when they tell you!_ This is the essence of real networking.

    Unfortunately, nobody will care about your problems. So if you want someone's attention, you need to care about _their_ problems first.

    Later, after you've become wealthy and/or powerful, you'll discover that other people have suddenly started to care about your problems.

**Why you're doing it:**

We've studied meetups a lot. It turns out the value you get from attending meetups compounds over time. It also compounds over different meetups across the same area, since the same people often go to multiple meetups.

Meeting Bob from Google for the first time at Meetup X is fine. Meeting Bob from Google for the sixth time at Meetup X is great. Meeting Bob from Google at Meetup Y, after you've already met him at Meetup X, is fantastic.

It will take you time to build up trust in a meetup community. But after you've built up a head of steam it's a great use of your time. I recommend prioritizing this for anyone who lives in a tech hub.

## How to apply online

The right way to apply online is **not** through job boards. The right way to apply online is to cold email specific people people inside a company. This section will tell you exactly how to do that.

**Note: The following advice applies best to companies that are ~500 employees or less. Applying to bigger companies takes a different strategy.**

**What to do:** I'm going to take you through a systematic strategy of email outreach. Keep in mind:

- You should apply online using cold email, _not_ using a job board
- If you ignore my advice and apply to a company through a job board anyway, then at least send a cold email to them _first, and only then_ apply to them through the job board
-  You can expect a response rate of **20-30%** on a good cold email
- You can expect a response rate of **1-2%** applying through a job board if you have a good resume

**How to do it**

**Step 0: Before you begin**

1. [Download Streak for gmail.](https://www.streak.com) Streak is a free browser extension that lets you see if an email you've sent has been opened or not.

2. [Install Sapling.ai.](https://sapling.ai) Sapling is a free browser extension (Chrome only) that automatically proofreads your emails for you.

3. [Install Snov.io.](https://snov.io) Snov is a freemium browser extension (Chrome only) that lets you find someone's email if you know 1) their name and 2) their company. You'll probably only need the free version.

**Step 1: Make a list of companies that have jobs you like**

1. Go on LinkedIn and search for "hiring data". Make sure to filter for `People`. You'll get a list of hits for people who are hiring data scientists, data engineers, and all kinds of other data roles. (You can search for "hiring machine learning" or "hiring X" to get similar results for roles in X.)

This is a strategy for finding really good data science jobs by piggybacking on Insight Data Science Fellows.

2. You can also look on job boards to find open positions. Just don't _apply_ anywhere through job boards. Here are some good ones you can use:

    - [Indeed](http://indeed.com), [AngelList](https://angel.co) and [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com)
    - [Remote ML](https://remoteml.com) is a board for remote ML jobs
    - [The Comet ML newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/mljobs?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=forwarded&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ML+Jobs+Newsletter) (subscription link at the top of the page)
    - [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com)
    - [Work At A Startup](http://workatastartup.com) by YC
    - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) puts up a "Who Is Hiring?" post every month where companies post open jobs. You can look up all the past Who Is Hiring posts [at this URL](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring).


3. Create a spreadsheet to list the companies that you want to apply to. Start by putting 10 companies on your spreadsheet to get used to the reach-out process. Then add more as you get comfortable.

**Step 2: Find people in those companies who are hiring:**

The second step is to find people who are actively hiring for their companies. If you did a search for "hiring" in Step 1, the people who came up in that search are  a good places to start. If not, I've written advice for you below on who you should go after.

👉 **Highly recommended reading:** [_How to send a cold email: Find the right contact_](https://datasciencecareermap.com/2019/05/03/how-to-send-a-cold-email-find-the-right-contact/) by mentor [Susan Holcomb](https://twitter.com/h0lc0mb). Tips on how to find the right person and how to get their email address.

**For companies of ~50 employees or less, the person you should contact is the company's CEO.** It might seem scary to email a CEO. But it's less scary when you realize that the worst thing they do is ignore you.

CEOs are in charge of the overall hiring objectives for their companies. If you send a CEO an email and you seem like a promising candidate, _you're helping the CEO with one of their key objectives._ **You are doing them a favor.** (Of course not every CEO will answer you, and don't take it personally if they don't.)

For that reason, most startup CEOs try hard to make themselves accessible over email. A startup CEO's email is usually `{CEO's first name}@{company domain}`. For example, my company email is `edouard[at]sharpestminds[dot]com`. It's easy to guess, because I _want_ interested people to email me.

You get two advantages if you email a founder-CEO. First, **it's easy to find something in common with them.** You know that the founder-CEO is passionate about their company's mission, because they founded it. So if you write an email that shows them you're also passionate about their company's mission, that will get their attention. For most CEOs, it's hard to find someone sincerely interested in their company's mission. Most people just reach out to them with some version of "I want a job".

The second advantage you get by emailing a CEO is that **it's easy for them to make a quick decision about you.** If you email a hiring manager, they have 10 seconds to decide if it's worth spending another 30 minutes of their own time talking to you. But if you email the CEO, from the CEO's point of view they can kick you over to their hiring manager with a recommendation that says "this person seems worth checking out". The CEO only has to decide if you're worth spending 30 minutes of _their hiring manager's time_ talking to. As you can imagine, they're much more likely to say yes.

And when a hiring manager gets an email from their CEO saying "you should talk to Bob", they are much more likely to talk to Bob.

**For companies of ~50-500 employees, the person you should contact is _either_ the company's VP of Engineering _or_ the company's Director of Data (or a similar title).** Same reasons apply as for the CEO above, except you should keep in mind that no one will be quite as personally invested in the company's mission as the CEO is.

Here's how to find the right people inside a company:

1. Search for the company's name on LinkedIn.

2. Find the company and click on their company page.

3. On the company page, click on "People".

4. Scroll until you find the CEO, VP Engineering, Director of Data, etc. If the company is big, you can also search for "VP" or "Director" to narrow down the results.

5. Add the person's name and LinkedIn name to your spreadsheet.

**Important:** Whatever you do, **don't email someone in human resources.** [HR staff aren't trained to evaluate you based on your technical merits,](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-no-one-will-tell-you-about-data-science-job-applications-bff2d4b5e983) and contacting them is an almost guaranteed waste of your time. You can tell if someone is in HR if their job title on LinkedIn is something like "Talent Acquisition Partner", "Recruitment Coordinator", "HR Director", "Head of People", or generally any title with the keywords "talent", "recruitment", "people", or "human resources / HR". **Avoid them.**

**Step 3: Research the company**

You're going to be emailing the people you found in **Step 2**. The kinds of people you'll be emailing get lots of email. So we want to make sure your email stands out compared to all the others they receive in a day.

The recipe to do that is
- Research the company
- Use their product (if possible)
- Make your email personable and specific (only possible if you've researched the company)
- Humbly suggest some ideas

This might seem like a lot of work for one email. It is. In fact, it's enough work that almost nobody does it. That's why it will make you stand out.

We recommend spending 30 minutes to an hour per company on research and writing the email. When you're starting out and still getting used to it, it's okay to spend more time than this.

That's a lot of time. But a good, well researched email will get you a response 20-30% of the time. That means even if you're putting in a full hour on each email, five hours of work per day will get you one positive response _per day_ from _very important people_ in a company.

If you wanted to get one response per day from job board applications, you'd need to be applying to around _a hundred jobs per day_. Even then the responses you'd be getting would be from recruiters rather than hiring managers, so much less valuable to you.

**Note:** If there's a company you _really_ want to work at, it's okay to research them for up to 1-2 days, and even put together a minor demo for them and link to it in your email. That will give you a better conversion rate, but we find an hour of research is usually the point of diminishing returns.

**Step 4: Write the email**

👉 **You must read this first:** [_How to write a cold email_](https://datasciencecareermap.com/2019/05/09/how-to-write-a-cold-email/) by mentor [Susan Holcomb](https://twitter.com/h0lc0mb). This is some of the best advice on the Internet about how to structure a great cold email to land a data science or ML job.

_Here is a template email you should use if you've been able to research the company you want to work at:_

> Hi Ron,

> I've been following XYZ Robotics for a while and I've found your Medium articles very interesting. They provide a clear understanding of how XYZ Robotics is tackling the problems that the autonomous vehicle industry is currently facing. Particularly your explanation for not including LIDAR in your systems is a good reminder that you select the tools based on the problems you are solving and not the other way around.

> I'm fascinated by your idea of "one step at a time" problem solving, and I would love to talk about what I can offer to your mission.

> About myself, I'm a Machine Learning Researcher with the experience in signal and image processing. I've been working on the problem of brainwave classification using convolutional neural networks where I achieved a 124% performance improvement over traditional methods. This research has allowed me to keep myself updated on the CNN and computer vision literature. I'm also part of a data science mentorship program in which I've been working on achieving state-of-the-art performance for music genre classification with a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon.

> I've attached my resume, which provides a more in-depth view of my qualification and experience.

> I'm excited to take the skills and knowledge I have and apply them to help make safe autonomous trucks a reality. I'd love to schedule a phone call to chat a bit about what I can offer you and to see if I will be a good fit on your team.

> Best,

> Bob Mentee

> [bobmentee.com](http://example.com)

This was sent by a mentee to the CEO of a successful YC-backed robotics company. The CEO responded, and the mentee got the interview.

A few things to note about this email:

- The mentee highlights the experience he has that's **most relevant** (computer vision, because the company is building autonomous trucks) and **most impressive** (beating state of the art in brainwave and music classification).
- The email opens with a personal compliment to the CEO. We all love getting personal compliments.
- The email also quotes one of the CEO's own insights. This shows the mentee took the time to read something the CEO wrote.
- The company's name was spelled correctly. Nothing destroys your chances faster than spelling a company's name wrong in an email to the CEO.
- Most sentences are short and crisp. The mentee used [Sapling](https://sapling.ai) to proofread his email before he sent it.
- The mentee's personal website is in his email signature. That means he doesn't need to attach his resume to the email he sends. If the CEO is curious, he can just go to the website and find links to everything he needs.
- Bonus: The mentee used [Streak](http://streak.com) to confirm that the CEO had actually opened his email.

The idea behind the ideal email structure is to open with a compliment that shows clearly that you've put work into understanding your target and their company; include an explanation of yourself with links to your work; humbly mention some relevant thing that you've done; and polish it off by including your personal website or LinkedIn in the email signature.

If your target does not have any blog posts or active social media accounts, the fallback is to see if the company itself, or the DS team within the company, has written blog posts about itself.

_If for whatever reason, you aren't able to find anything written by the company you want to work at, you should use [the email template in Susan's blog post.](https://datasciencecareermap.com/2019/05/09/how-to-write-a-cold-email/)_ This will give you a slightly lower response rate than a custom-researched email, but is still **at least 10X** better than applying through a job board.

The team's mission can usually be found by searching through the company's website, or by looking at members of the team on LinkedIn (particularly senior members). Sometimes you can't find it; then, revert to [Susan’s blog post again.](https://datasciencecareermap.com/2019/05/09/how-to-write-a-cold-email/)

You absolutely _do not_ need to read a bunch of books by your target, or every blog post your target has ever written, before you reach out to them. Just look at the titles, find one or two that look interesting to you, and skim them for 10-20 minutes. The sweet spot is to find one non-trivial fact that sincerely interests you.

A final thought: I asked one of our mentors, who works at a $100B+ company in Silicon Valley, how he evaluates these kinds of cold emails himself. Here's what he says:

> For cold emails (and to a little extent the resume profiling as well), there is one key question I would like to answer: Am I speaking to an enthusiast who simply switched to the field because of the hype, or to someone who is genuinely passionate about the craft? For students and junior engineers, I would be interested in knowing their learning path, and if they went a little out of the way to accomplish something (eg: do a course, publish a paper, speak at a conference /meetup etc) — something as proof which can help me validate my guess as to that question.

**Step 5: Send a _polite_ follow up**

If you don't hear back from the person you've emailed within a week, you should send **one** polite follow up email. This should be sent as a reply to your first email, to ensure both show up in the same message thread.

Here's a template you can use for a follow up email:

> Hi Ron,

> I just wanted to quickly follow up with you in case my previous email got buried. Did you have any thoughts or feedback on whether my skills and interests might fit into your team?

> In case you're too busy to respond, I want you to know in any case that what [your company / group] are working on has been a real source of inspiration for me. If I can be of any help whatsoever going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!

> Bob Mentee

> [bobmentee.com](http://example.com)

Notice how we include a warm compliment in the second paragraph! **You should change this compliment to suit your own personality and match your feelings about the company or group.** Sincere compliments generate far more responses than generic ones.

If you don't hear back from your follow-up email after one week, you might not have to give up on the company. Try picking someone further down in the company's hierarchy, and repeating the process. Obviously you'll have to re-customize the outreach email to this new person.

For example, you can email the CEO on Week 1, follow up with the CEO on Week 2; email the VP Eng on Week 3, follow up with the VP Eng on Week 4; and email the hiring manager on Week 5, and follow up with the hiring manager on Week 6.

Obviously you should be running this process with _lots_ of companies at the same time. Otherwise it will take you forever to get hired. If you're going full-out on job applications, you should be targeting **~25-30 emails like this each week.**

Once you get good, you'll be allocating about 30-60 minutes per email. It may take you a couple of weeks to ramp up to that level, but once you do you've basically won - getting hired is only a matter of time and maintaining your pace.

## How to use the SharpestMinds network

A few tips on how to leverage SM's network for maximum benefit:

1. If you write a good blog post let us know, and we'll promote it! We can give you **significant** reach: SharpestMinds content gets **over a quarter of a million** monthly views across all social media platforms, and we have deals with major data science publications like [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com) where we may be able to get your post featured.

    **If English isn't your first language** and you've written a blog post, let us know. We have a deal with [AnnieCannons](https://anniecannons.com) in which they get English graduates to proofread our mentees' blog posts. **This service is 100% free for mentees.**

2. If you plan to reach out to someone by email or via LinkedIn, let us know who it is! We can try to connect with them on LinkedIn so that they see our announcements. This often makes folks more receptive to interviewing SharpestMinds students.

3. When requesting warm intros through the hiring partners system, make sure to pick companies that you're sincerely interested in. It isn't worth wasting a warm intro on an informational interview.

4. When requesting an intro through the hiring parnters system, **do not apply online** before the intro. This changes the frame from "here's a smart person I know" to "here's someone trying to get an edge in their job application". Applying online first significantly reduces the chance of an intro converting.

5. There are hundreds of world-class data scientists and machine learning engineers in our Slack workspace. If you have a question that you can't find the answer to online, Slack is probably the best place to ask it.

# Checklist: at a networking event or job fair

1. You should be mostly trying to talk to companies that you superficially fit with. i.e., there's a crude label you can give yourself in a quick conversation that makes you seem like you'd be _unusually_ suited to work at that company. It doesn't have to be an exact fit, just something that signal-boosts you vs. all the other junior applicants who won't be using this strategy.

2. Example: suppose you're a former controls engineer. Then you can mentally label yourself with the keywords, e.g., "controls & industrial engineering". And therefore, you should be targeting companies like [Canvass](https://www.canvass.io) (industrial IoT), [Quartic.ai](http://quartic.ai) (smart manufacturing), and [SolidState](https://www.solidstate.ai) (process optimization for chip manufacturing). Everyone has at least one label they can use; many have several. If you're not sure what yours is/are, message an admin and we can help you figure it out!

3. When talking to a company rep at a job fair, remember that you're the 50th of 100 people they'll be talking to that day. Your label / keyword is the most information you can reasonably expect them to retain about you. So make it stick!

4. People are much more interested in their own problem than in yours. So ask them what their problems are!

5. When you talk to someone, get their business card and add them to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is key, because otherwise they'll forget the link between your name and your face. Make sure your LinkedIn has an up to date profile photo that looks like you.

6. Reach out to them after the event ends, and _follow up_. Expect to have to follow up an _anomalously high_ number of times. Networking events always generate a ton of connections for everybody, most of which go nowhere. Personalize your follow ups. They don't remember you, _but you should remember them_ - that's how you stand out!

# Checklist: how to network on LinkedIn

1. **For most people**, there isn't any value in collecting random LinkedIn connections if you don't know them and they don't know you. You should connect with someone on LinkedIn if you, at a minimum: a) have met them in person, or 2) have already had 2-way communication with them some other way (email, Twitter, etc.).

2. If you want to follow someone's posts on LinkedIn (e.g., [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/)), don't connect with them; *follow* them.

3. While you should never try to connect with *random* people you don't know, it can be a good idea to connect with *specific* people you don't know. For example, if someone is a hiring manager at a company you want to work at, it can be a good idea to connect with them. The points below explain how to do that.

4. Here's the situation. Suppose you really want to get hired at Uber Data Science in Seattle. You're being mentored by, e.g., a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte.

5. Start by searching for folks who work at Uber DS in Seattle on LinkedIn. Identify their Twitter accounts, Medium blogs, any online presence by any of them. Engage with them personally as much as possible - smart, positive comments on Twitter, Medium posts, etc. Do that for at least 1 week with as many of them as possible.

6. Then, connect with as many as you can on LinkedIn with a personal, customized message ideally that references other stuff they've written online. People *love it* when you quote their own insights back to them.

7. Once you're connected and you can message them without character limits, try to start a conversation. The trick is, don't ask for something - *offer* something. One good strategy is to combine an idea with an implied compliment. Example: I'm working on this data science project with a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte (instant signal of high value). I had `this thought / idea / insight`, I've been following your work for the last little while, and been really impressed, and I'd really value your thoughts on it.

8. This says to me: 1) A Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte thinks you're a valuable enough person to spend time working on a project with, so you must be valuable. 2) You think independently, since you've had this insight. 3) you've been following my work on the Internet and despite having access to a Senior DS at Deloitte you respect my work so much that you think I'm worth reaching out to about this.

9. Do this with a small handful of people at first, and you're almost guaranteed to start a productive conversation with at least one of them.

10. **Important:** Don't send generic messages to a ton of people. Impersonal LinkedIn spam will *only* damage your reputation. When in doubt, ask yourself: Does this message make it obvious that I've spent more than 5 minutes investigating this person's online presence? If the answer isn't "heck yes", then keep working on your message.

# Checklist: how to interview

1. To prepare for the interview, follow the advice at the end of [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996). It's geared to software engineering, but can be easily adapted to ML / data science.

2. To prepare for the interview, use the Briefcase Technique - [described in this blog post.](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/the-briefcase-technique/) It's especially useful if there's one company that you _really_ want to work at and you get an interview. (Ignore the marketing-speak in the linked blogpost, the technique works and that's what matters.)

3. To **practice** interviewing, there are two resources you can use. First, you can message an admin on Slack and ask to be connected to another mentee for practice interviews. Second, you can use [pramp](https://www.pramp.com/). Pramp (short for PRActice Makes Perfect) is a free interview prep service that pairs you with interviewers to practice job interviews. Recommended by one of our mentors! 👍

4. Find out who is going to be interviewing you, then look them up on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Most questions in interviews have many correct answers, so the more context you have on your interviewer, the better you'll be able to predict which correct answers they're looking for! **Elite tip:** It can be a great idea to quote some of their own insights back at them, if they've written in blogs or on Twitter.

5. During the interview, you might get asked if you have any questions for the interviewer about the team or the organization. [Here's a great list of questions you can ask](https://doctorj.gitlab.io/interview-questions/); pick a few you find most interesting.

6. Getting no follow up after an interview is _not unusual_ - in this or in any other activity where you're selling yourself. Remember that you're playing a numbers game: each time you practice the technical interview your odds for the next time around go up.

7. If you don't hear back from the interviewer: follow up with them 2-3 times by email (once every 2-3 days) with a simple, polite request for feedback. If you can combine that with a thought or a suggestion that would help their business (e.g., "I was thinking about the way you model sales for widgets, and it occurred to me that you might get better performance if you used model X instead of model Y because of Z"), that's :100:.

8. Your frame of mind is: you are a person who can add significant value to their business. If they don't want you, no problem: you will find another business and you will add value over there instead. There's no emotional component to the decision from either side; it's just business.

9. To keep your energy high, _focus on the process, not the goal_. Allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment when you learn things that improve your process for applying / interviewing / etc.
**Focus on the inputs and the output will come eventually** :muscle:.

10. In other words: learn as much as you can from each no, then deliberately move on. **It doesn't matter how many nos you get.** All that matters is that one of them is a yes. And that will happen!!!

# 🌍 If you are **not** a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident

If you aren't a resident of either the USA or Canada, you might need a permit or a work visa to get a job in either country.

If you want to work in the USA, you'll probably need an H1B visa. Getting one is hard, and it's gotten harder recently. It also restricts your options to only applying to companies that sponsor H1B. It doesn't cost a company that much (~$5k) but not all of them sponsor H1B because it can sometimes take up to 6 months for one to get approved.

If you'd like to work in the USA eventually, you should seriously think about first working in Canada, building up a year's experience, and only then going back and applying for jobs in the USA. Not only will you be in less of a rush that way, you'll also have the leverage that comes from having 1+ years of industry experience. In fact, some employers don't sponsor visas for junior engineers, but do sponsor them for mid and senior level engineers. That means you'll have more options if you're in the latter category.

If you're trying to get a job in Canada, the visa process is a lot easier. Canada has a program called the Global Talent Stream (GTS), which is designed to bring highly skilled international talent into the country. The GTS is similar to the H1B, except that there are no quotas and you can get approved for one in 5-10 business days instead of six months. You do need to get a job that has a minimum annual salary; you can find out what that minimum is [at this website](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/227159).

### SharpestMinds deals for international residents

If you're an international resident trying to get a job in Canada, SharpestMinds can help you in two ways:

1. We have a deal with [MaRS](https://www.marsdd.com), a Canadian government/industry organization. Under our deal, MaRS staff will personally support any SharpestMinds student in navigating Canada's GTS visa system. But more than that: **MaRS will also handle the GTS application process for any company that hires one of our grads!** Make sure to mention this if you're interviewing at a Canadian company, because they need to know this before the offer stage. Having MaRS handle their application process probably saves them ~$4k in legal fees they'd otherwise have to pay if they hired you.

   How do you bring up this deal during an interview? Try saying something like: "If `[company name]` is open to hiring through the  Global Talent Stream, I'm part of a program that covers the legal work to file an application for any company that hires me through GTS, at zero cost except the government filing fee. I can put you in touch with them if you want." If they ask for more information, you can tell them what's on this page, or even refer them to this repo if that's easier. And of course, you can connect them to an admin, who will answer their questions and connect them to the MaRS team.

2. We also have an agreement with [GlobalSkills.io](http://globalskills.io), a recruiting company that places internationals at Canadian companies through GTS. If you're international, they can connect you to their hiring partners and help their partners with the GTS application process.

Both of the deals above are free for you to use, so take advantage of them! To redeem either deal, DM an admin on SharpestMinds Slack and we'll get you set up.

# Random FAQ

### What if I don't know what career path to follow?

Use the Waterloo strategy. Here's what that is: (1) you work at a tiny startup that can't afford anyone better; (2) you work at a BigCo or consulting firm like KPMG or Oracle; (3) you work at a startup at Series A or Series B; (4) you work at Google or Facebook; (5) you work wherever you want.

### I just got a job offer. Should I negotiate the salary?

Yes!!! The moment you get a job offer, **contact an admin** and we'll give you advice to help you negotiate the salary number.

### What kinds of meetups should I go to for networking?

Most meetups you go to will be a waste of time, but when you're starting you should go to all of them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. The good ones will (1) be **technical**; (2) be **small**; and (3) **repeat often** (e.g. once a week). If you can't get all 3, then prioritize (1) and (3). A meetup that repeats often means you'll build long term relationships with the participants, many of whom will be hiring managers you want to work for.

This strategy is way more successful than going to one-off "networking" events. Real networking is more than adding someone on LinkedIn: it's about building relationships that compound over time. The sooner you start, the better.

### How can I tell if a company's ML team is actually good?

Evaluating the work of a company's ML/DS team from the outside can be irreducibly hard. Usually, you can't assess the quality of their work upfront because as an outsider you can see neither the inputs nor the outputs. My best advice is: ask them during the interview. Try to figure out what goes in, what comes out, how the pipeline is organized, and then ask yourself if it all seems reasonable.

### How do I follow up on an intro email?

Here's a great phrase one of our earliest mentees used to use after getting an email intro from us to company XYZ:

> Can you tell me more about what XYZ co is up to? What's the tightest bottleneck at the moment?

^ What a great line! It shows he's zeroing in right away on what's most important _to them_. Use it! (Adapt the wording to suit your personality. You may also have to substitute "XYZ co" for "your team at XYZ co" if XYZ co is bigger than ~20 employees.)

Here's an example of an incredibly good followup to an intro email.

> Hi Edouard, Thanks for the intro! (Moving to BCC)

> Hi `[name]`, It's great to meet you!
> I'd read a few online articles about `[company]`'s work, but it was going through your website and blog that really got me interested in the company.

> A little about myself: I'm transitioning into Data Science from Data Analytics, and my most recent role was as an engineer at XYZ Industries, Canada's largest ports and logistics company. I have experience using SQL to perform data analysis on port operations datasets and suggest improvements. I was also part of the team which streamlined the freight shipment process by analysing the transit-time data, increasing the port's logistics efficiency by 45% by reducing the turn around time of trailers.

> If you want to learn a little more about me I have a website where you can find my portfolio and resume: pranavrajt.com

> I'm pretty excited about the approach `[company]` has taken to address these complicated and fascinating questions, and I would love to schedule a phone call to chat a bit about what I can offer you, and to see if I would be a good fit for your team.

> Is there a time this week or next that works best for you? I'm available on `[insert three time slots here]`

> Best,

### Is there anything different about being a data scientist at a small (~20 employee) company?

Yes. I won't be able to do any better at explaining this than to point you to [this Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c).

### If I'm given a take home test with no deadline, how long should I take to submit it?

Here's some advice from our mentors:

> There is always a deadline. If not mentioned, ask for it. Many peope think that if you have a FT job and turn the assignment in less than a day, you are taking time off your current job which is a red flag.

> It's totally up to the employer. (...) For the problems with no deadline, spend as much time as you need to. They're more concerned about the quality and how you answer the question than handing it in as soon as possible.

In other words: it depends. When in doubt, ask your mentor or message an admin on Slack.

### Do I have to apply to jobs on my own, or does SharpestMinds refer to me companies?

Both. We can (and do) refer you to companies directly, but you absolutely need to continue applying on your own - otherwise you'll miss out on a ton of opportunities that you'd otherwise get to see.

But our hiring network gives you a second advantage beyond direct referrals. When you apply to companies in our network and get turned down, it's often possible for us to discover the real reason why. In normal cases, when you apply for a position and get turned down, you'll never find out why. But when you apply to companies on our network, we're often able to use our personal relationships with them to get feedback that helps you improve your next application.

The best way to think about it is this: your job is to keep applying to positions, and our job is to increase the chances of each application leading to a high-paying job offer.

### How do I add SharpestMinds to my resume?

It can help to mention your mentor's company on your resume if it's well-known. We'll continue to support you even after your mentorship ends, so it's correct to say on your resume that you're still at SharpestMinds, even if your mentorship term has ended. Here's an example of how to include SharpestMinds on your resume:

   ![How to include SharpestMinds on your resume](https://github.com/sharpest-minds/hiring-tips/blob/master/img/sm-in-resume.png)
