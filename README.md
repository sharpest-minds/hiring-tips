# Checklist: after you join

1. If you don't have a LinkedIn account, get one. Add your mentor and every mentee you know on LinkedIn. And add [us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e10is/) [admins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremieharris/) [too](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-pollari-b555895a/)!

2. We have a deal with [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) to give every mentee $50 in free GPU credits. Use them! To get your credits, message an admin on Slack or post to the mentees channel.

3. You can also get $300 in free GCP credits (any service) via their [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

4. If you write a good blog post, let us know and we'll promote it. We can give you **significant** reach: SharpestMinds content gets **over a quarter of a million** monthly views across all social media platforms, and we have deals with major data science publications like [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com).

# Checklist: once you hit the halfway point of your mentorship

1. Make a list of all the regular, small, technical [meetups](https://www.meetup.com) in your city. Ideally something where you discuss a paper or write actual code in a workshop. Start going, even if you sit in a corner and do nothing the first couple of times. The benefit of having industry people see your face every week compounds quickly.

2. Check out our list of hiring partners [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee/companies). We can often give warm introductions to many of the companies on this list, which lets you to skip their HR screens - a big advantage. **Please keep this list confidential.** You can request warm intros to companies directly through the SharpestMinds web app.

3. Start applying to jobs. Here are some good places to apply for ML jobs [that aren't generally known](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-no-one-will-tell-you-about-data-science-job-applications-bff2d4b5e983):

   üëâ Applying through [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com) sends a good signal to hiring managers, because they tend to attract good engineers as applicants. (Applying through Indeed sends a bad signal to hiring managers, so you shouldn't do it.)

   üëâ Y Combinator's [Work At A Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com) page is another great one. This lets you submit a single application to all YC companies.

   üëâ [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) puts up a "Who Is Hiring?" post every month where companies post open jobs. A great hack is to look up all the past Who Is Hiring posts [at this URL](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring). Instructions on how to apply to each job are included in the comments. Check it out!

   üëâ The [Comet ML newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/mljobs?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=forwarded&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ML+Jobs+Newsletter) is another great place to apply for ML jobs. We highly recommend subscribing: you'll get a list of ML jobs delivered to your inbox every two weeks.

7. If the hiring manager whose group / company you're trying to join has a Twitter account, follow it. If they have a blog, read it. Same goes for engineers in the group / company you're trying to join.

# Job search, part 1: creating first impressions

Later on I'll cover how to reach out to companies in your job search. Before that, you need to prepare the way for yourself. In this section I'll cover how to curate your online presence to make your value obvious.

The more obvious your value is, the more receptive companies will be when you reach out to them, and the easier they'll be to negotiate with. If you follow the advice in this section properly, you might even find recruiters start to reach out to you. (Don't let that go to your head - a recruiter reaching out isn't that valuable by itself. It's just a sign you're on the right track.)

## Your email address

When you apply for jobs, never use Yahoo or Hotmail as your email account. Gmail _can be okay_, but **only** your email address is something like firstname.lastname@gmail.com.

**What to do:** buy your own domain name and set up an email account on it. For example, if your name is John Q. Smith, your email should be john@jqsmith.com, john@johnqsmith.com or something like that.

**How to do it:**
1. Buy your domain from a registrar like [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com). If you need help doing this, message an admin for advice. Whatever you do, make sure you get the `.com`.
2. Follow the instructions in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vQyhVOhNVw) to set up your email account. Make sure you test that your account works before using it to apply for jobs.

**Why you're doing it:** You want to create the following impression in the mind of anyone who gets an email from you: "Wow... this person has their life together more than I do."

## Your personal website

You do need to have a personal website. But you don't need to over-think it.

**What to do:** set up a website for yourself at the same domain as your email. Your personal website only needs to have 3 things on it:

- Your name.

- A one-line blurb that describes you.

- Links to your other online profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium).

That's it. You can add other things too, if you want. Just make sure those 3 things are on there.

We recommend using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to make your website because it's easy and fast. Check out [Russell's personal website](http://russellpollari.com) for a great example.

**How to do it:**

1. [Follow these instructions](https://godaddy.com/help/getting-started-with-wordpress-5140) to set up a Wordpress site on a GoDaddy domain. If you didn't use GoDaddy to buy your domain, Google for instructions for your domain provider.

2. Add the content you need.

3.  Play around with the design until you like the way it looks.

**Why you're doing it:** When someone who doesn't know you gets an email from your personal domain, 2 out of 3 times they'll navigate straight to your personal website to find out more about you. Make sure that personal website exists.

It's also a good idea to put a link to your personal website in your email signature.

## Your GitHub profile

GitHub is where the rubber hits the road. It's where you show off the real meat of the projects you've done: not just explaining them, but showing the quality of your code. :octocat:

**What to do:** If you don't have a GitHub account, get one. Don't feel bad if it's empty at first. It's _far_ better to have a single project that you're diving deep on than to have 20 projects that are all forks with 1 commit each.

Here's a checklist of the bare minimum your GitHub account should have:
- A repository for each of the projects you've done
- A README file for each of your projects with a clear explanation of what it does and how to run it
- Bonus points: A link to a URL where I can test a demo version of your project
- Bonus points: If this is your mentorship project, include a log in the README of the changes you're making, along with the dates. This makes it obvious your project is under active development

**How to do it:**

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, [create one](http://github.com).

2. Add a profile pic of yourself that matches the profile pics you use on other professional networks (LinkedIn especially).

3. Run through the checklist in the **What to do** section above and make sure you implement everything on there.

4. Add your SharpestMinds mentorship project to your GitHub. This should be one of the projects you're going deep on, so include lots of detail, explanations, and ideally pictures.

**Why you're doing it:** It's basically guaranteed that at some point during your job application process to _any_ company, someone technically capable is going to look at your GitHub profile. So make sure it looks good.

## Your resume

As you gain more experience, your resume will matter less and less. But early on, it matters a lot.

**What to do:** Put together or update your resume. Make sure it's geared towards data science roles.

Here's a list of common mistakes I see in resumes, plus a rating of how bad they are, either üòë (annoying) or ‚ò†Ô∏è (deadly). Avoid them:

- Spelling mistakes ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Inconsistent formatting üòë
- So much text I can't get through it to read the important parts üòë
- Including a picture of yourself üòë
- Gaps in your timeline so I can't tell what you were doing during some time period ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Not ordering your timeline chronologically üòë
- Listing Microsoft Office as one of your skills ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Listing MNIST, the Titanic dataset, or another generic project in your list of projects ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Submitting your resume in any format other than a PDF ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Including a detailed description of your graduate thesis if it isn't directly ML-related üòë
- Including a list of publications if they aren't ML-related üòë
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" üòë
- Having a resume that is 1 page long plus one sentence, instead of _either_ 1 page long or 1.5 pages long üòë

And here's a list of things you can do to make your resume stronger, with a rating of how good they are, either üôå (solid) or üéâ (amazing). Do all of these:

- [Include SharpestMinds in your resume under Experience](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) üéâ
- Make sure your Skills section is at the top of the resume üôå
- Divide your skills into "advanced" skills and "experience with" skills üôå
- If you've had technical or business jobs before, list your dollar contributions to them (e.g., increase revenues by X%, reduced costs by $Y) üéâ
- List a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series) üôå
- Provide GitHub links to your best projects üôå
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading üéâ
- Make sure your writing is clear and concise. Use short sentences, with one idea per sentence üéâ

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a resume, skip the first 2 steps.)

1.  Start by picking a format. You can use a free resume template like [this one.](http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/)

2. Start filling in the sections. [This template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nN8ruroM-Msu8zyFz9rQlzoCjzv6GD5YI8PzP9DJTKc/edit) should you a good idea of what content to include. (Warning: the content in that example is good, but its format is terrible. Don't make your resume look like this.)

The next steps involve subjecting your resume to multiple rounds of review. üö®üö® **Don't skip any of these steps, even if some of them overlap with each other:**

3. Navigate to [this link](https://medium.com/@avishalom/resume-mistake-bingo-c08df472976e). Go through all 24 mistakes on the list and **eliminate them from your resume.**

4. Navigate to [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e). Go through all 4 mistakes on the list and **eliminate them from your resume.**

5. Scroll back up to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes I've listed (üòë, ‚ò†Ô∏è) and **eliminate them from your resume.**

6. Scroll back up _again_ to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the improvements I've listed (üôå, üéâ) and **add them to your resume.**

7. Post your resume to the [#roastmyresume](https://sm-mentorship.slack.com/messages/CG8T413BM/) channel on SharpestMinds Slack and let us tear it apart!

8. As your _last_ step, ask your mentor to take a look at your resume and offer some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**Why you're doing it:** If you're trying to get your first job in data science or ML, your resume might be the single most important document you'll create to help you do that. It's worth spending lots of time on it to make it good.

## Your LinkedIn profile

You probably have a LinkedIn account already. If you don't have one yet, get one.

**What to do:** Create or polish your LinkedIn account. You should think about your LinkedIn profile the same way an ambitious person thinks about what to wear in an office: _dress for the job you want, not the job you have._

Here's a list of mistakes I see often in LinkedIn profiles. I've rated these mistakes as either üòë (annoying) or ‚ò†Ô∏è (deadly). Some of the mistakes are the same as the ones in the resume section and some are different. To avoid:

- Spelling mistakes ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Weird capitalization of your own name, e.g., "BOB JOHNSON" ‚ò†Ô∏è
- **Not** having a profile picture üòë
- Having a profile picture that looks like a mugshot ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Gaps in your timeline of education or experience üòë
- Mentioning that you have "communication skills" üòë
- Calling yourself an "aspiring" data scientist ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Having recently commented on someone else's LinkedIn post along the lines of "I sent you a message yesterday. Please respond!!!" Your comment history is **immediately** visible on your profile and this makes you look desperate ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Long taglines in your profile, e.g., "Graduated | Actively looking for openings in startups and internships | Software, Machine learning, IT, Data Analyst" ‚ò†Ô∏è

And here's a list of ways of strengthening your LinkedIn profile. Many of these are the same as for your resume; some are solid (üôå) and some are amazing (üéâ). Do these all:

- Give yourself a tagline that looks like a job title, e.g., "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", or "Machine Learning Researcher", depending on what describes your project best üéâ
- Make sure you're smiling in your profile picture üôå
- In your description, list a few ML data types you're familiar working with (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series). Recruiter will find you based on these keywords! üéâ
- In your description, mention 2-3 key accomplishments you have in data science or ML. Your format should be: I accomplished `X`, as measured by `Y`, by doing `Z`. For example, "I saved ABC Corp $1M per year by building them a new ML model for widgets", "I hit the top 10% in this Kaggle competition by applying the method from this research paper", or even, "I built a grocery store inventory manager 3X more efficient than the legacy system, [by collecting the data I needed with my smartphone](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cold-start-problem-how-to-build-your-machine-learning-portfolio-6718b4ae83e9)" üéâ
- In your description, mention what fields you're interested in (e.g., healthcare, finance). Don't mention more than 3 üôå
- Include SharpestMinds in your experience, [using the same format as for your resume](#how-do-i-add-sharpestminds-to-my-resume) üéâ
- If you've been promoted, list your original and promoted position as 2 job titles under one company heading üôå
- Make sure your writing is clear and concise. Use short sentences, with one idea per sentence üéâ
- Make sure you add logos to the list of companies you've worked at üôå

**How to do it:**

(If you already have a LinkedIn profile, skip the first step.)

1.  Create your [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profile. Make sure it's connected to an email account that you check regularly.

The next steps involve subjecting your LinkedIn to multiple rounds of review. üö®üö® **Don't skip any of these steps, even if some of them overlap with each other:**

2. Scroll back up to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the common mistakes I've listed (üòë, ‚ò†Ô∏è) and **eliminate them from your resume.**

3. Scroll back up _again_ to the "What to do" section above. Go through all the improvements I've listed (üôå, üéâ) and **add them to your resume.**

4. As your _last_ step, ask your mentor to take a look at your LinkedIn and offer you some final advice.

**Tip:** to fix spelling and grammar, download [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Sapling.ai](https://sapling.ai) Chrome extension and run them _both_ over your resume. Start with Grammarly first, then use Sapling. Grammarly and Sapling catch different kinds of mistakes, but Sapling is better than Grammarly so it should be used last.

**Why you're doing it:** You're going to be reaching out to hiring managers and CEOs on LinkedIn _a lot_. When you do, those hiring managers and CEOs will look at your profile as the first thing they do. So make sure it's bulletproof!

# Checklist: at a networking event or job fair

1. You should be mostly trying to talk to companies that you superficially fit with. i.e., there's a crude label you can give yourself in a quick conversation that makes you seem like you'd be _unusually_ suited to work at that company. It doesn't have to be an exact fit, just something that signal-boosts you vs. all the other junior applicants who won't be using this strategy.

2. Example: suppose you're a former controls engineer. Then you can mentally label yourself with the keywords, e.g., "controls & industrial engineering". And therefore, you should be targeting companies like [Canvass](https://www.canvass.io) (industrial IoT), [Quartic.ai](http://quartic.ai) (smart manufacturing), and [SolidState](https://www.solidstate.ai) (process optimization for chip manufacturing). Everyone has at least one label they can use; many have several. If you're not sure what yours is/are, message an admin and we can help you figure it out!

3. When talking to a company rep at a job fair, remember that you're the 50th of 100 people they'll be talking to that day. Your label / keyword is the most information you can reasonably expect them to retain about you. So make it stick!

4. People are much more interested in their own problem than in yours. So ask them what their problems are!

5. When you talk to someone, get their business card and add them to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is key, because otherwise they'll forget the link between your name and your face. Make sure your LinkedIn has an up to date profile photo that looks like you.

6. Reach out to them after the event ends, and _follow up_. Expect to have to follow up an _anomalously high_ number of times. Networking events always generate a ton of connections for everybody, most of which go nowhere. Personalize your follow ups. They don't remember you, _but you should remember them_ - that's how you stand out!

# Checklist: how to network on LinkedIn

1. **For most people**, there isn't any value in collecting random LinkedIn connections if you don't know them and they don't know you. You should connect with someone on LinkedIn if you, at a minimum: a) have met them in person, or 2) have already had 2-way communication with them some other way (email, Twitter, etc.).

2. If you want to follow someone's posts on LinkedIn (e.g., [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/)), don't connect with them; *follow* them.

3. While you should never try to connect with *random* people you don't know, it can be a good idea to connect with *specific* people you don't know. For example, if someone is a hiring manager at a company you want to work at, it can be a good idea to connect with them. The points below explain how to do that.

4. Here's the situation. Suppose you really want to get hired at Uber Data Science in Seattle. You're being mentored by, e.g., a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte.

5. Start by searching for folks who work at Uber DS in Seattle on LinkedIn. Identify their Twitter accounts, Medium blogs, any online presence by any of them. Engage with them personally as much as possible - smart, positive comments on Twitter, Medium posts, etc. Do that for at least 1 week with as many of them as possible.

6. Then, connect with as many as you can on LinkedIn with a personal, customized message ideally that references other stuff they've written online. People *love it* when you quote their own insights back to them.

7. Once you're connected and you can message them without character limits, try to start a conversation. The trick is, don't ask for something - *offer* something. One good strategy is to combine an idea with an implied compliment. Example: I'm working on this data science project with a Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte (instant signal of high value). I had `this thought / idea / insight`, I've been following your work for the last little while, and been really impressed, and I'd really value your thoughts on it.

8. This says to me: 1) A Senior Data Scientist at Deloitte thinks you're a valuable enough person to spend time working on a project with, so you must be valuable. 2) You think independently, since you've had this insight. 3) you've been following my work on the Internet and despite having access to a Senior DS at Deloitte you respect my work so much that you think I'm worth reaching out to about this.

9. Do this with a small handful of people at first, and you're almost guaranteed to start a productive conversation with at least one of them.

10. **Important:** Don't send generic messages to a ton of people. Impersonal LinkedIn spam will *only* damage your reputation. When in doubt, ask yourself: Does this message make it obvious that I've spent more than 5 minutes investigating this person's online presence? If the answer isn't "heck yes", then keep working on your message.

# Checklist: how to apply

1. If there's a specific company you're interested in working with, and that company has open source projects on GitHub, it's a *very* good idea to contribute to their open source codebases. For example, if you really wanted to be hired by Uber, you could contribute to [this project](https://github.com/uber/ludwig). If you have a contribution accepted, you can and should list this on your resume under a section like "Open Source Contributions".

# Checklist: how to interview

1. To prepare for the interview, follow the advice at the end of [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996). It's geared to software engineering, but can be easily adapted to ML / data science.

2. To prepare for the interview, use the Briefcase Technique - [described in this blog post.](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/the-briefcase-technique/) It's especially useful if there's one company that you _really_ want to work at and you get an interview. (Ignore the marketing-speak in the linked blogpost, the technique works and that's what matters.)

3. To **practice** interviewing, there are two resources you can use. First, you can message an admin on Slack and ask to be connected to another mentee for practice interviews. Second, you can use [pramp](https://www.pramp.com/). Pramp (short for PRActice Makes Perfect) is a free interview prep service that pairs you with interviewers to practice job interviews. Recommended by one of our mentors! üëç

4. Find out who is going to be interviewing you, then look them up on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Most questions in interviews have many correct answers, so the more context you have on your interviewer, the better you'll be able to predict which correct answers they're looking for! **Elite tip:** It can be a great idea to quote some of their own insights back at them, if they've written in blogs or on Twitter.

5. During the interview, you might get asked if you have any questions for the interviewer about the team or the organization. [Here's a great list of questions you can ask](https://doctorj.gitlab.io/interview-questions/); pick a few you find most interesting.

6. Getting no follow up after an interview is _not unusual_ - in this or in any other activity where you're selling yourself. Remember that you're playing a numbers game: each time you practice the technical interview your odds for the next time around go up.

7. If you don't hear back from the interviewer: follow up with them 2-3 times by email (once every 2-3 days) with a simple, polite request for feedback. If you can combine that with a thought or a suggestion that would help their business (e.g., "I was thinking about the way you model sales for widgets, and it occurred to me that you might get better performance if you used model X instead of model Y because of Z"), that's :100:.

8. Your frame of mind is: you are a person who can add significant value to their business. If they don't want you, no problem: you will find another business and you will add value over there instead. There's no emotional component to the decision from either side; it's just business.

9. To keep your energy high, _focus on the process, not the goal_. Allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment when you learn things that improve your process for applying / interviewing / etc.
**Focus on the inputs and the output will come eventually** :muscle:.

10. In other words: learn as much as you can from each no, then deliberately move on. **It doesn't matter how many nos you get.** All that matters is that one of them is a yes. And that will happen!!!

# üåç If you are **not** a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident

If you aren't a resident of either the USA or Canada, you might need a permit or a work visa to get a job in either country.

If you want to work in the USA, you'll probably need an H1B visa. Getting one is hard, and it's gotten harder recently. It also restricts your options to only applying to companies that sponsor H1B. It doesn't cost a company that much (~$5k) but not all of them sponsor H1B because it can sometimes take up to 6 months for one to get approved.

If you'd like to work in the USA eventually, you should seriously think about first working in Canada, building up a year's experience, and only then going back and applying for jobs in the USA. Not only will you be in less of a rush that way, you'll also have the leverage that comes from having 1+ years of industry experience. In fact, some employers don't sponsor visas for junior engineers, but do sponsor them for mid and senior level engineers. That means you'll have more options if you're in the latter category.

If you're trying to get a job in Canada, the visa process is a lot easier. Canada has a program called the Global Talent Stream (GTS), which is designed to bring highly skilled international talent into the country. The GTS is similar to the H1B, except that there are no quotas and you can get approved for one in 5-10 business days instead of six months. You do need to get a job that has a minimum annual salary; you can find out what that minimum is [at this website](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/227159).

### SharpestMinds deals for international residents

If you're an international resident trying to get a job in Canada, SharpestMinds can help you in two ways:

1. We have a deal with [MaRS](https://www.marsdd.com), a Canadian government/industry organization. Under our deal, MaRS staff will personally support any SharpestMinds student in navigating Canada's GTS visa system. But more than that: **MaRS will also handle the GTS application process for any company that hires one of our grads!** Make sure to mention this if you're interviewing at a Canadian company, because they need to know this before the offer stage. Having MaRS handle their application process probably saves them ~$4k in legal fees they'd otherwise have to pay if they hired you.

   How do you bring up this deal during an interview? Try saying something like: "If `[company name]` is open to hiring through the  Global Talent Stream, I'm part of a program that covers the legal work to file an application for any company that hires me through GTS, at zero cost except the government filing fee. I can put you in touch with them if you want." If they ask for more information, you can tell them what's on this page, or even refer them to this repo if that's easier. And of course, you can connect them to an admin, who will answer their questions and connect them to the MaRS team.

2. We also have an agreement with [GlobalSkills.io](http://globalskills.io), a recruiting company that places internationals at Canadian companies through GTS. If you're international, they can connect you to their hiring partners and help their partners with the GTS application process.

Both of the deals above are free for you to use, so take advantage of them! To redeem either deal, DM an admin on SharpestMinds Slack and we'll get you set up.

# Random FAQ

### What if I don't know what career path to follow?

Use the Waterloo strategy. Here's what that is: (1) you work at a tiny startup that can't afford anyone better; (2) you work at a BigCo or consulting firm like KPMG or Oracle; (3) you work at a startup at Series A or Series B; (4) you work at Google or Facebook; (5) you work wherever you want.

### I just got a job offer. Should I negotiate the salary?

Yes!!! But before you do, you should do two things. First, **tell your mentor about it so they can help you negotiate.** Second, [read this blog post](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/). It'll be worth your time, I promise.

### What kinds of meetups should I go to for networking?

Most meetups you go to will be a waste of time, but when you're starting you should go to all of them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. The good ones will (1) be **technical**; (2) be **small**; and (3) **repeat often** (e.g. once a week). If you can't get all 3, then prioritize (1) and (3). A meetup that repeats often means you'll build long term relationships with the participants, many of whom will be hiring managers you want to work for.

This strategy is way more successful than going to one-off "networking" events. Real networking is more than adding someone on LinkedIn: it's about building relationships that compound over time. The sooner you start, the better.

### How can I tell if a company's ML team is actually good?

Evaluating the work of a company's ML/DS team from the outside can be irreducibly hard. Usually, you can't assess the quality of their work upfront because as an outsider you can see neither the inputs nor the outputs. My best advice is: ask them during the interview. Try to figure out what goes in, what comes out, how the pipeline is organized, and then ask yourself if it all seems reasonable.

We also try to help with this problem by giving companies technical ratings in our hiring partners list, [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee-resources). (Note: missing ratings don't necessarily mean we thing a company is bad, just that we may lack information.)

### How do I follow up on an intro email?

Here's a great phrase one of our earliest mentees used to use after getting an email intro from us to company XYZ:
> Can you tell me more about what XYZ co is up to? What's the tightest bottleneck at the moment?

^ What a great line! It shows he's zeroing in right away on what's most important _to them_. Use it! (Adapt the wording to suit your personality. You may also have to substitute "XYZ co" for "your team at XYZ co" if XYZ co is bigger than ~20 employees.)

Here's an example of an incredibly good followup to an intro email. **Your followup should probably be shorter than this**, but I like this one as an example because it nails everything you might want to say in a followup.

> Hi Edouard,
> Thanks for the intro!
> (moved to BCC)

> Hi `[name]`,
> It's great to meet you!¬†

> I read a few online articles about your mission with `[company name]`, but it was your Quora post that really helped a lot of my thoughts and ideas coalesce into more definite questions.

> For example, what makes a person interesting, and how can you quantify whether someone would fit in a certain group? What are the best ways to facilitate meaningful interactions between humans and what are good metrics to quantify how successful the interaction was? How can a social network scale without diluting the essence of what makes it so fun?¬†`[NOTE: These   questions are specific to the company, which is a special kind of social network.]`

> I'm pretty excited about the approach `[company name]` has taken to address these complicated and fascinating questions, and I would love to talk about what I can offer to help your mission.

> A little more about me: I'm a painter (mostly watercolor), as well as a data scientist. Given these two interests, my specialty lies in taking numbers and functions and turning them into visually appealing images that convey complex ideas in a simple, and visually appealing manner.¬† I also have a passion for both communicating and absorbing new ideas.

> If you want to learn a little more about me I have a website where you can find a¬†blog post¬†about me, as well as other posts about code I've written: `[link to website]`

> My current project, with a SharpestMinds mentor, is taking some medium size (~7 GB, 40 columns) data and feeding it into machine learning models to predict changes in customer behavior.¬†

> I'm pretty excited to take the skills and knowledge I have and apply them to helping to build a great social networking platform for `[company name]`. I would love to schedule a phone call to chat a bit about what I can offer to you, and to see if I would be a good fit on your team.

> Best,

### Is there anything different about being a data scientist at a small (~20 employee) company?

Yes. I won't be able to do any better at explaining this than to point you to [this Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c).

### If I'm given a take home test with no deadline, how long should I take to submit it?

Here's some advice from our mentors:

> There is always a deadline. If not mentioned, ask for it. Many peope think that if you have a FT job and turn the assignment in less than a day, you are taking time off your current job which is a red flag.

> It's totally up to the employer. (...) For the problems with no deadline, spend as much time as you need to. They're more concerned about the quality and how you answer the question than handing it in as soon as possible.

In other words: it depends. When in doubt, ask your mentor or message an admin on Slack.

### Do I have to apply to jobs on my own, or does SharpestMinds refer to me companies?

Both. We can (and do) refer you to companies directly, but you absolutely need to continue applying on your own - otherwise you'll miss out on a ton of opportunities that you'd otherwise get to see.

But our hiring network gives you a second advantage beyond direct referrals. When you apply to companies in our network and get turned down, it's often possible for us to discover the real reason why. In normal cases, when you apply for a position and get turned down, you'll never find out why. But when you apply to companies on our network, we're often able to use our personal relationships with them to get feedback that helps you improve your next application.

The best way to think about it is this: your job is to keep applying to positions, and our job is to increase the chances of each application leading to a high-paying job offer.

### How do I add SharpestMinds to my resume?

You should mention your mentor's name and company (unless your mentor asks you not to), so that their prestige will rub off on you. We'll continue to support you even after your mentorship ends, so it's correct to say on your resume that you're still at SharpestMinds, even if your mentorship term has ended. Here's an example of how to include SharpestMinds on your resume:

   ![How to include SharpestMinds on your resume](https://github.com/sharpest-minds/hiring-tips/blob/master/img/sm-in-resume.png)

**Important:** If you haven't been in the program very long (2 months or less), you should title this, e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer (Project)" instead of just "Machine Learning Engineer". If recruiters see you've only been a Data Scientist for a month, they may wonder why you're trying to switch jobs so soon!
