# hiring-tips
Compendium of tips on how to get hired in ML / data science via your mentorship. Includes tools &amp; links. **Please keep this repo confidential.**

[Click here for tips on starting and structuring a mentorship](./mentorship.md)

In addition to what's below, you'll find more useful information on [our blog page](https://www.sharpestminds.com/blog).

# Checklist: after you join

1. If you don't have a LinkedIn account, get one. Add your mentor and every mentee you know on LinkedIn. And add [us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e10is/) [admins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremieharris/) [too](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-pollari-b555895a/)!

2. We have a deal with [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) to give every mentee $50 in free GPU credits. Use them! To get your credits, message an admin on Slack or post to the mentees channel.

3. You can also get $300 in free GCP credits (any service) via their [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

4. If you write a good blog post, let us know and we'll promote it. We can give you **significant** reach: SharpestMinds content gets **over a quarter of a million** monthly views across all social media platforms, and we have deals with major data science publications like [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com).

# Checklist: once you hit the halfway point of your mentorship

1. Make a list of all the regular, small, technical [meetups](https://www.meetup.com) in your city. Ideally something where you discuss a paper or write actual code in a workshop. Start going, even if you sit in a corner and do nothing the first couple of times. The benefit of having industry people see your face every week compounds quickly.

2. Check out our list of hiring partners [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee/companies). We can often give warm introductions to many of the companies on this list, which lets you to skip their HR screens - a big advantage. **Please keep this list confidential.**

3. Start applying to jobs. When applying online, you should apply through [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com). That sends a good signal to hiring managers. You shouldn't apply through Indeed. That sends a bad signal to hiring managers.

4. A second good place to apply is Y Combinator's [Work At A Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com) page. This lets you submit a single application to all YC companies.

4. A third tool you can use to apply online is [TalentWorks](https://talent.works/automate-your-job-search). This is an automated job search service that costs $5-10 a week. If you use TalentWorks, please let us know how it went for you. If enough people use it and like it, we'll try to get a bulk deal with them to save you money.

5. If the hiring manager whose group / company you're trying to join has a Twitter account, follow it. If they have a blog, read it. Same goes for engineers in the group / company you're trying to join.

6. Don't use Yahoo or Hotmail as your email account when applying to jobs. Instead, you should either (1) Use gmail, **but only if** your email address is something like firstname.lastname@gmail.com; or (2) buy your own domain name and set up a mailserver on it. For example, if your name is John Q. Smith, your email should be john@jqsmith.com, john@johnqsmith.com or something like that. Owning your own domain is much better than using gmail.

7. Build a personal website for yourself. You don't need to know how to code one. The easiest way to do this is to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The slightly harder (but better) way is to host at your own domain name, and build the website with an editor like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) or [Webflow](https://webflow.com). (Pro tip: add a link to your website to the bottom of your email signature.)

# Checklist: at a networking event or job fair

1. You should be mostly trying to talk to companies that you superficially fit with. i.e., there's a crude label you can give yourself in a quick conversation that makes you seem like you'd be _unusually_ suited to work at that company. It doesn't have to be an exact fit, just something that signal-boosts you vs. all the other junior applicants who won't be using this strategy.

2. Example: suppose you're a former controls engineer. Then you can mentally label yourself with the keywords, e.g., "controls & industrial engineering". And therefore, you should be targeting companies like [Canvass](https://www.canvass.io) (industrial IoT), [Quartic.ai](http://quartic.ai) (smart manufacturing), and [SolidState](https://www.solidstate.ai) (process optimization for chip manufacturing). Everyone has at least one label they can use; many have several. If you're not sure what yours is/are, message an admin and we can help you figure it out!

3. When talking to a company rep at a job fair, remember that you're the 50th of 100 people they'll be talking to that day. Your label / keyword is the most information you can reasonably expect them to retain about you. So make it stick!

4. People are much more interested in their own problem than in yours. So ask them what their problems are!

5. When you talk to someone, get their business card and add them to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is key, because otherwise they'll forget the link between your name and your face. Make sure your LinkedIn has an up to date profile photo that looks like you.

6. Reach out to them after the event ends, and _follow up_. Expect to have to follow up an _anomalously high_ number of times. Networking events always generate a ton of connections for everybody, most of which go nowhere. Personalize your follow ups. They don't remember you, _but you should remember them_ - that's how you stand out!

# Checklist: applying and interviewing

1. Don't have a resume? Make one. [Use this template for the format](http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/), [and use this template for the content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nN8ruroM-Msu8zyFz9rQlzoCjzv6GD5YI8PzP9DJTKc/edit). Go through it and correct [these very common resume mistakes](https://medium.com/@avishalom/resume-mistake-bingo-c08df472976e). Then go through it _again_, and correct [these other resume mistakes that are specific to ML and data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e)!

2. It's a very good idea to add SharpestMinds to your resume. You should mention your mentor's name and company, so that their prestige will rub off on you. Keep in mind that we'll continue to support you even after your mentorship ends, so it's correct to say on your resume that you're still at SharpestMinds, even if your term has ended. Here's an example of how to include SharpestMinds on your resume:

![How to include SharpestMind on your resume](https://github.com/sharpest-minds/hiring-tips/blob/master/img/sm-in-resume.png)

3. If English isn't your first language (and even if it is), consider using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) for your resume, blog posts, and emails. Hiring managers will often reject you out of hand for misspellings and grammar errors, and Grammarly is an easy way to save yourself from that.

4. To prepare for the interview, follow the advice at the end of [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996). It's geared to software engineering, but can be easily adapted to ML / data science.

5. To prepare for the interview, use the Briefcase Technique - [described in this blog post.](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/the-briefcase-technique/) It's especially useful if there's one company that you _really_ want to work at and you get an interview. (Ignore the marketing-speak in the linked blogpost, the technique works and that's what matters.)

6. Find out who is going to be interviewing you, then look them up on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Most questions in interviews have many correct answers, so the more context you have on your interviewer, the better you'll be able to predict which correct answers they're looking for! **Elite tip:** It can be a great idea to quote some of their own insights back at them, if they've written in blogs or on Twitter.

7. During the interview, you might get asked if you have any questions for the interviewer about the team or the organization. [Here's a great list of questions you can ask](https://doctorj.gitlab.io/interview-questions/); pick a few you find most interesting.

8. Getting no follow up after an interview is _not unusual_ - in this or in any other activity where you're selling yourself. Remember that you're playing a numbers game: each time you practice the technical interview your odds for the next time around go up.

9. If you don't hear back from the interviewer: follow up with them 2-3 times by email (once every 2-3 days) with a simple, polite request for feedback. If you can combine that with a thought or a suggestion that would help their business (e.g., "I was thinking about the way you model sales for widgets, and it occurred to me that you might get better performance if you used model X instead of model Y because of Z"), that's :100:.

10. Your frame of mind is: you are a person who can add significant value to their business. If they don't want you, no problem: you will find another business and you will add value over there instead. There's no emotional component to the decision from either side; it's just business.

11. To keep your energy high, _focus on the process, not the goal_. Allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment when you learn things that improve your process for applying / interviewing / etc.
**Focus on the inputs and the output will come eventually** :muscle:.

12. In other words: learn as much as you can from each no, then deliberately move on. **It doesn't matter how many nos you get.** All that matters is that one of them is a yes. And that will happen!!!

# 🌍 If you are **not** a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident

If you aren't a resident of either the USA or Canada, you might need a permit or a work visa to get a job in either country.

If you want to work in the USA, you'll probably need an H1B visa. Getting one is hard, and it's gotten harder recently. It also restricts your options to only applying to companies that sponsor H1B. It doesn't cost a company that much (~$5k) but not all of them sponsor H1B because it can sometimes take up to 6 months for one to get approved.

If you'd like to work in the USA eventually, you should seriously think about first working in Canada, building up a year's experience, and only then going back and applying for jobs in the USA. Not only will you be in less of a rush that way, you'll also have the leverage that comes from having 1+ years of industry experience. In fact, some employers don't sponsor visas for junior engineers, but do sponsor them for mid and senior level engineers. That means you'll have more options if you're in the latter category.

If you're trying to get a job in Canada, the visa process is a lot easier. Canada has a program called the Global Talent Stream (GTS), which is designed to bring highly skilled international talent into the country. The GTS is similar to the H1B, except that there are no quotas and you can get approved for one in 5-10 business days instead of six months. You do need to get a job that has a minimum annual salary; you can find out what that minimum is [at this website](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/occupation/227159).

### SharpestMinds deals for international residents

If you're an international resident trying to get a job in Canada, SharpestMinds can help you in two ways:

1. We have a deal with [MaRS](https://www.marsdd.com), a Canadian government/industry organization. Under our deal, MaRS staff will personally support any SharpestMinds student in navigating Canada's GTS visa system. But more than that: **MaRS will also handle the GTS application process for any company that hires one of our grads!** Make sure to mention this if you're interviewing at a Canadian company, because they need to know this before the offer stage. Having MaRS handle their application process probably saves them ~$4k in legal fees they'd otherwise have to pay if they hired you.

   How do you bring up this deal during an interview? Try saying something like: "If `[company name]` is open to hiring through the  Global Talent Stream, I'm part of a program that covers the legal work to file an application for any company that hires me through GTS, at zero cost except the government filing fee. I can put you in touch with them if you want." If they ask for more information, you can tell them what's on this page, or even refer them to this repo if that's easier. And of course, you can connect them to an admin, who will answer their questions and connect them to the MaRS team.

2. We also have an agreement with [GlobalSkills.io](http://globalskills.io), a recruiting company that places internationals at Canadian companies through GTS. If you're international, they can connect you to their hiring partners and help their partners with the GTS application process.

Both of the deals above are free for you to use, so take advantage of them! To redeem either deal, DM an admin on SharpestMinds Slack and we'll get you set up.

# Random FAQ

### What if I don't know what career path to follow?

Use the Waterloo strategy. Here's what that is: (1) you work at a tiny startup that can't afford anyone better; (2) you work at a BigCo or consulting firm like KPMG or Oracle; (3) you work at a startup at Series A or Series B; (4) you work at Google or Facebook; (5) you work wherever you want.

### I just got a job offer. Should I negotiate the salary?

Yes!!! But before you do, you should do two things. First, **tell your mentor about it so they can help you negotiate.** Second, [read this blog post](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/). It'll be worth your time, I promise.

### What kinds of meetups should I go to for networking?

Most meetups you go to will be a waste of time, but when you're starting you should go to all of them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. The good ones will (1) be **technical**; (2) be **small**; and (3) **repeat often** (e.g. once a week). If you can't get all 3, then prioritize (1) and (3). A meetup that repeats often means you'll build long term relationships with the participants, many of whom will be hiring managers you want to work for.

This strategy is way more successful than going to one-off "networking" events. Real networking is more than adding someone on LinkedIn: it's about building relationships That compound over time. The sooner you start, the better.

### How can I tell if a company's ML team is actually good?

Evaluating the work of a company's ML/DS team from the outside can be irreducibly hard. Usually, you can't assess the quality of their work upfront because as an outsider you can see neither the inputs nor the outputs. My best advice is: ask them during the interview. Try to figure out what goes in, what comes out, how the pipeline is organized, and then ask yourself if it all seems reasonable.

We also try to help with this problem by giving companies technical ratings in our hiring partners list, [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee-resources). (Note: missing ratings don't necessarily mean we thing a company is bad, just that we may lack information.)

### How do I follow up on an intro email?

Here's a great phrase one of our earliest mentees used to use after getting an email intro from us to company XYZ:
> Can you tell me more about what XYZ co is up to? What's the tightest bottleneck at the moment?

^ What a great line! It shows he's zeroing in right away on what's most important _to them_. Use it! (Adapt the wording to suit your personality. You may also have to substitute "XYZ co" for "your team at XYZ co" if XYZ co is bigger than ~20 employees.)

### Is there anything different about being a data scientist at a small (~20 employee) company?

Yes. I won't be able to do any better at explaining this than to point you to [this Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c).
