# hiring-tips
Compendium of tips on how to get hired in ML / data science via your mentorship. Includes tools &amp; links. **Please keep this repo confidential.**

In addition to what's below, you'll find lots more useful information on [our blog page](https://www.sharpestminds.com/blog).

# Checklist: after you join

1. If you don't have a LinkedIn account, get one. Add your mentor and every mentee you know on LinkedIn. And add [us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e10is/) [admins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremieharris/) [too](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-pollari-b555895a/)!

2. We have a deal with [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) to give every mentee $50 in free GPU credits. Use them! To get your credits, message an admin on Slack or post to the mentees channel.

3. You can also get $300 in free GCP credits (any service) via their [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

4. If you write a good blog post, let us know and we'll promote it. We can give you **significant** reach: SharpestMinds content gets **~100k** monthly views across all social media platforms, and we have deals with major data science publications like [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com).

# Checklist: once you hit the halfway point of your mentorship

1. Make a list of all the regular, small, technical [meetups](https://www.meetup.com) in your city. Ideally something where you discuss a paper or write actual code in a workshop. Start going, even if you sit in a corner and do nothing the first couple of times. The benefit of having industry people see your face every week compounds quickly.

2. Check out our list of hiring partners [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee-resources). We can often give warm introductions to many of the companies on this list, which lets you to skip their HR screens - a big advantage. **Please keep this list confidential.**

3. Start applying to jobs. When applying online, you should apply through [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com). That sends a good signal to hiring managers. You shouldn't apply through Indeed. That sends a bad signal to hiring managers.

4. A second good place to apply is Y Combinator's [Work At A Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com) page. This lets you submit a single application to all YC companies.

4. A third tool you can use to apply online is [TalentWorks](https://talent.works/automate-your-job-search). This is an automated job search service that costs $5-10 a week. If you use TalentWorks, please let us know how it went for you. If enough people use it and like it, we'll try to get a bulk deal with them to save you money.

5. If the hiring manager whose group / company you're trying to join has a Twitter account, follow it. If they have a blog, read it. Same goes for engineers in the group / company you're trying to join.

6. Don't use Yahoo or Hotmail as your email account when applying to jobs. Instead, you should either (1) Use gmail, **but only if** your email address is something like firstname.lastname@gmail.com; or (2) buy your own domain name and set up a mailserver on it. For example, if your name is John Q. Smith, your email should be john@jqsmith.com, john@johnqsmith.com or something like that. Owning your own domain is much better than using gmail.

7. Build a personal website for yourself. You don't need to know how to code one. The easiest way to do this is to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The slightly harder (but better) way is to host at your own domain name, and build the website with an editor like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) or [Webflow](https://webflow.com).

# Checklist: at a networking event or job fair

1. You should be mostly trying to talk to companies that you superficially fit with. i.e., there's a crude label you can give yourself in a quick conversation that makes you seem like you'd be _unusually_ suited to work at that company. It doesn't have to be an exact fit, just something that signal-boosts you vs. all the other junior applicants who won't be using this strategy.

2. Example: suppose you're a former controls engineer. Then you can mentally label yourself with the keywords, e.g., "controls & industrial engineering". And therefore, you should be targeting companies like [Canvass](https://www.canvass.io) (industrial IoT), [Quartic.ai](http://quartic.ai) (smart manufacturing), and [SolidState](https://www.solidstate.ai) (process optimization for chip manufacturing). Everyone has at least one label they can use; many have several. If you're not sure what yours is/are, message an admin and we can help you figure it out!

3. When talking to a company rep at a job fair, remember that you're the 50th of 100 people they'll be talking to that day. Your label / keyword is the most information you can reasonably expect them to retain about you. So make it stick!

4. People are much more interested in their own problem than in yours. So ask them what their problems are!

5. When you talk to someone, get their business card and add them to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is key, because otherwise they'll forget the link between your name and your face. Make sure your LinkedIn has an up to date profile photo that looks like you.

6. Reach out to them after the event ends, and _follow up_. Expect to have to follow up an _anomalously high_ number of times. Networking events always generate a ton of connections for everybody, most of which go nowhere. Personalize your follow ups. They don't remember you, _but you should remember them_ - that's how you stand out!

# Checklist: applying and interviewing

1. Don't have a resume? Make one. [Use this template for the format](http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/), [and use this template for the content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nN8ruroM-Msu8zyFz9rQlzoCjzv6GD5YI8PzP9DJTKc/edit). Go through it and correct [these very common resume mistakes](https://medium.com/@avishalom/resume-mistake-bingo-c08df472976e). Then go through it _again_, and correct [these other resume mistakes that are specific to ML and data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e)!

2. To prepare for the interview, follow the advice at the end of [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996). It's geared to software engineering, but can be easily adapted to ML / data science.

3. To prepare for the interview, use the Briefcase Technique - [described in this blog post.](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/the-briefcase-technique/) It's especially useful if there's one company that you _really_ want to work at and you get an interview. (Ignore the marketing-speak in the linked blogpost, the technique works and that's what matters.)

4. Find out who is going to be interviewing you, then look them up on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Most questions in interviews have many correct answers, so the more context you have on your interviewer, the better you'll be able to predict which correct answers they're looking for! **Elite tip:** It can be a great idea to quote some of their own insights back at them, if they've written in blogs or on Twitter.

5. During the interview, you might get asked if you have any questions for the interviewer about the team or the organization. [Here's a great list of questions you can ask](https://doctorj.gitlab.io/interview-questions/); pick a few you find most interesting.

5. Getting no follow up after an interview is _not unusual_ - in this or in any other activity where you're selling yourself. Remember that you're playing a numbers game: each time you practice the technical interview your odds for the next time around go up.

6. If you don't hear back from the interviewer: follow up with them 2-3 times by email (once every 2-3 days) with a simple, polite request for feedback. If you can combine that with a thought or a suggestion that would help their business (e.g., "I was thinking about the way you model sales for widgets, and it occurred to me that you might get better performance if you used model X instead of model Y because of Z"), that's :100:.

7. Your frame of mind is: you are a person who can add significant value to their business. If they don't want you, no problem: you will find another business and you will add value over there instead. There's no emotional component to the decision from either side; it's just business.

8. To keep your energy high, _focus on the process, not the goal_. Allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment when you learn things that improve your process for applying / interviewing / etc.
**Focus on the inputs and the output will come eventually** :muscle:.

9. In other words: learn as much as you can from each no, then deliberately move on. **It doesn't matter how many nos you get.** All that matters is that one of them is a yes. And that will happen!!!

# Random FAQ

### What if I don't know what career path to follow?

Use the Waterloo strategy. Here's what that is: (1) you work at a tiny startup that can't afford anyone better; (2) you work at a BigCo or consulting firm like KPMG or Oracle; (3) you work at a startup at Series A or Series B; (4) you work at Google or Facebook; (5) you work wherever you want.

### I just got a job offer. Should I negotiate the salary?

Yes!!! But before you do, you should do two things. First, **tell your mentor about it so they can help you negotiate.** Second, [read this blog post](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/). It'll be worth your time, I promise.

### What kinds of meetups should I go to for networking?

Most meetups you go to will be a waste of time, but when you're starting you should go to all of them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. The good ones will (1) be **technical**; (2) be **small**; and (3) **repeat often** (e.g. once a week). If you can't get all 3, then prioritize (1) and (3). A meetup that repeats often means you'll build long term relationships with the participants, many of whom will be hiring managers you want to work for.

This strategy is way more successful than going to one-off "networking" events. Real networking is more than adding someone on LinkedIn: it's about building relationships That compound over time. The sooner you start, the better.

### How can I tell if a company's ML team is actually good?

Evaluating the work of a company's ML/DS team from the outside can be irreducibly hard. Usually, you can't assess the quality of their work upfront because as an outsider you can see neither the inputs nor the outputs. My best advice is: ask them during the interview. Try to figure out what goes in, what comes out, how the pipeline is organized, and then ask yourself if it all seems reasonable.

We also try to help with this problem by giving companies technical ratings in our hiring partners list, [at the bottom of this page](https://app.sharpestminds.com/mentee-resources). (Note: missing ratings don't necessarily mean we thing a company is bad, just that we may lack information.)

### How do I follow up on an intro email?

Here's a great phrase one of our earliest mentees used to use after getting an email intro from us to company XYZ:
> Can you tell me more about what XYZ co is up to? What's the tightest bottleneck at the moment?

^ What a great line! It shows he's zeroing in right away on what's most important _to them_. Use it! (Adapt the wording to suit your personality. You may also have to substitute "XYZ co" for "your team at XYZ co" if XYZ co is bigger than ~20 employees.)
