- I'm working on this data science project, to parse out ingredients from user taken images of food labels and provide wikipedia links, with a Machine Learning Engineer at American Express. I had this thought of further implementing some NLP and recommendation systems to provide alternate options for products for people with allergies. ([Pranavraj Thilagaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranavrajt/) with mentor [(Andy) Kok-Leong Seow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kokleongseow/))
- Designed and deployed a web application that allows users to upload an MP3 file and see a prediction of their age range. The app uses a model I built for Neurolex Labs. Used React, Flask, Docker, and AWS. ([Rajesh Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-singh-110810124/) with mentor [(Andy) Kok-Leong Seow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kokleongseow/))

([Dyllan McCreary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dyllan-mccreary-570140154/) with mentor [Joe Papa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrjoepapa/))
- Building a personalized food recommendation system by analyzing user genome data & nutrients in different food products. Combining data from various sources and using machine learning to process genome data to recommend healthy products. ([Atishay Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atishaycn/) with mentor [Oren Shklarsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orenshk/))
- Used gensim and nltk libraries for topic modeling on Twitter data. Working on getting the twitter data on to MongoDB and then processing/ modeling the data. Finally, to bring a model to a production level deployable model through Dockers.
