An activley maintanied resource of best practices and tips around mentorships.  
If you are a SharpestMinds mentor, please contribute!

## Interview checklist
 - What is your schedule like, and how much time can you commit?
 - Educational background / MOOCs
 - Have you done any other data science projects, walk me through one?
 - What problem or project would you like to work on?
 - Ideal company/role?
 - Where have you applied already?

## Mentorship checklist
A checklist of things to consider when starting a mentorship:

1. **Schedule weekly meetings:**
 - Pick a time and place (e.g. google hangouts, Wednesdays 6pm).
 - Both of you will probably have to reschedule some weeks so set some guidelines around this (e.g. let eacho ther know 24 hours ahead of time if you need to reschedule).
2. **Agree on meeting format:**
 - *Suggestion:* Review last weeks goals, set new goals for week
 - *Suggestion:* Keep a running list of non-urgent issues/questions/things to bring up during meeting (both mentee and mentor should do this)
3. **Set expectations:**
 - Honesty is important, be honest about what mentee's should expect from you and what you expect from them
 - Tell mentees to be honest if they feel like they are not getting enough value or are unsatisfied with the mentorship (let us know if this happens, SharpestMinds can help you sort it out).
 - What is your availability?
 - What is the primary commuication channel? (eg. email, slack, SharpestMinds) and what will your response rate be like?
4. **Create a rough plan/timeline:**
 - This will likely evolve a lot in the first couple weeks as you both get comfortable and settle on a well-defined project
 - If there is no project decided on already, make this the goal of the first week. Point the mentee towards some resources / sources of data / or suggest your own project ideas
 - **TODO**: link to example projects from other SharpestMinds mentorships
 - Projects should loosely follow these steps:
 	- Data collection
	- Data analysis/exploration
	- Feature engineering/selection
	- Model building
	- Model deployment
 - *Suggestion*: Set up a GitHub repo, and have mentee submit PRs for your approval
 - *Sugegstion*: encourage mentee to write blog posts about significant milesetons
 - **TODO**: Link to some resources on structuring a data science project
 - **pro-tip:** Try and structure workflow like you would in an industry setting. (e.g. agile/scrum, CI/CD tooling)
 - **TODO**: list useful tools for remote collaboration
4. **Add mentee to your network**
 - Connect on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc
 - Provide details about useful meetups/events/groups
 - Ask mentee what their ideal company/role is? Think about any of your connections that you might be able to connect them with.
 - **Note:** many new grads are pretty ignorant about the possible roles out there and won't have a great idea of what they are looking for. This is ok, they just need more exposure. Setting up informational interviews with people in your network can be very helpful to start giving them a birds-eye view of the industry
 - If your mentee (and you) build something cool, let us know, and we will **share the crap out of it** with our rapidly growing network
 - Encourage mentees to attend SharpestMinds office hours and connect with other mentees
